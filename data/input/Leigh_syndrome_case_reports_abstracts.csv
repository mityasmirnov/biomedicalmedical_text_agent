Additionally, a literature review was conducted.All four children had plasma amino acid and acylcarnitine analyses that revealed decreased citrulline levels, and one child was initially identified through neonatal genetic metabolic disease screening. According to the literature review, there were 26 children with mitochondrial disease and hypocitrullinemia caused by the m.8993T>G mutation (including the four children in this study). Among these, 12 children exhibited clinical phenotypes of Leigh syndrome or Leigh-like syndrome, while 18 children were identified with hypocitrullinemia and/or elevated levels of 3-hydroxyisovalerylcarnitine (C5-OH) during neonatal genetic metabolic disease screening.Hypocitrullinemia may serve as a potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of m.8993T>G mutation-associated Leigh syndrome, detectable as early as during neonatal genetic metabolic disease screening."

Cytochrome C oxidase deficiencies due to SURF1 Cytochrome C Oxidase Assembly Factor (SURF1) gene mutations are seen only in 15% of LD cases. Consideration of these genetic mutations in young patients is crucial for early diagnosis, intervention, and further genetic counseling. Although only a few cases of the SURF1 mutation have been reported, there are anecdotal case reports describing imaging features. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 2-year-old boy with developmental delay, hypotonia, involuntary movements, shortness of breath, and reduced activity since age 6 months. On blood examination there was mildly elevated lactate levels and increased lactate to pyruvate ratio and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels. Magnetic resonance imaging findings showed symmetrical lesions in the dentate nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain (substantia nigra, periaqueductal gray matter), posterolateral pons, and olivary nucleus of the medulla extending into the cervical spinal cord, with mild elevation of the lactate peak on magnetic resonance spectroscopy. CONCLUSIONS These findings prompted further genetic analysis, which indicated a mitochondrial type IV deficiency with the SURF1 gene defect, an intranuclear type 1 mutation (MC4DN1) (OMIM 220110). Treatment is usually supportive with vitamins supplementation and physiotherapy, and genetic counseling of the parents is mandatory."

The patient, born to consanguineous parents, presented with developmental delay, cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and seizures. Diagnostic evaluation at 15 months revealed 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, and subsequent genetic testing through whole exome sequencing confirmed a rare homozygous deletion variant in the SERAC1 gene. The patient exhibited brain atrophy, tracheal stenosis, laryngomalacia, and skeletal abnormalities. The complexity of MEGDEL syndrome manifestations and the challenge of distinguishing it from other metabolic disorders are discussed, emphasizing the significance of genetic testing in confirming the diagnosis. This case underscores the occurrence of MEGDEL syndrome in a child with cerebral palsy, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach for diagnosis and the need for genetic counseling in consanguineous families. Although the management remains primarily supportive, the report calls for more comprehensive epidemiological studies to determine the prevalence and incidence of MEGDEL syndrome.

It is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the SERAC1 gene. Due to the unspecific symptoms and the diverse manifestations of the clinical phenotype, the diagnosis is challenging. Infantile MEGDHEL syndrome often has a severe disease course with acute liver failure. Differentiation from other metabolic disorders is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary approach.A two-day-old small for gestational age neonate was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to severe liver failure with distinct hyperammonemia and hypoglycemia without elevation of transaminases or cholestasis. Due to high ammonia level, continuous hemodialysis was established immediately after admission. In addition, protein intake was stopped, and the patient anabolized with intravenous glucose. Temporary stabilization could be achieved after four days. In the further course, severe neurological and cardiocirculatory complications occurred, which ultimately led to the infant's death. In the metabolic diagnostics, a pronounced lactate acidosis and in urine an increased excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid as well as other metabolites of mitochondrial energy metabolism has been the leading findings besides the hyperammonemia. Post-mortem trio whole genome analysis detected a homozygous pathogenic variant in SERAC1 with evidence of SERAC1 deficiency leading to the diagnosis of infantile MEGDHEL syndrome.When pediatricians are faced with hepatopathy or even acute liver failure without elevation of transaminases or cholestasis in newborns, SERAC1 deficiency should be considered as a potential differential diagnosis. The initial treatment is based on the recommended management of suspected metabolic disorders. Even while no cure is available yet, patients should be offered proper supportive management through a multidisciplinary team. In addition, genetic confirmation of the diagnosis is important for the families, especially regarding further family planning.If a newborn presents with hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia and impaired liver synthesis function without elevation of transaminases or cholestasis, the possible presence of MEGDHEL syndrome due to a SERAC1 mutation should be considered.© 2024 Kirchberg, Lainka, Gangfuß, Kuechler, Baertling, Schlieben, Lenz and Tschiedel."

We constructed mitochondrial targeting sequences along with the codon-optimized MT-ND3 and imported them into the mitochondria.

Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase 2 ( IARS2 ) gene is a type of ARS that encodes mitochondrial isoleucine-tRNA synthetase. Pathogenic variants in the IARS2 gene are associated with mitochondrial disease which involves several patients presenting broad clinical phenotypes. These clinical phenotypes include West syndrome, Leigh syndrome, and Cataract, growth hormone deficiency, sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, and skeletal dysplasia syndrome. Only 29 cases have been reported worldwide. The patient manifested recurrent convulsions, and specific clinical manifestations included electrolyte disorders and recurrent infections. Methods  Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the child with West syndrome. Three-dimensional structure reconstruction and thermodynamic stability prediction were performed to further analyze the relationship between variation and phenotype. Conclusion  This study further expands the clinical spectrum of IARS2 pathogenic variants. The case summaries help raise clinical awareness of IARS2 -associated disease and reduce misdiagnosis.

Despite a normal CT angiogram, ongoing bleeding led to suspicion of AD, which was diagnosed using colonoscopy with limited bowel preparation. The patient underwent an open appendicectomy and was found to have AD of the tip of the appendix as the cause of the bleeding.

The leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat (LRPPRC) gene is one of the mitochondrial-related functions genes; variations in these genes are responsible for complex phenotypes that affect many organs such as the brain, liver, and muscles.This study enrolled a family with Leigh syndrome-like phenotype. The molecular diagnosis was conducted by first performing whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by Sanger sequencing.A novel splice-site variant (c.469 + 2T > A) at the exon-intron boundary in the LRPPRC gene was identified using the WES data analysis. Sanger validation confirmed the autosomal recessive inheritance of the identified variant. Based on the ACMG criteria for variant classification, PVS1 and PM2 suggest that the identified variant in the LRPPRC gene is likely to be pathogenic.To the best of our knowledge, there have been no previous reports of this variant in the LRPPRC gene. Our research not only identifies a novel variant in the LRPPRC gene, but also confirms the unresolved molecular diagnosis of the family. WES can be used as a first-line diagnostic tool in familial cases, particularly in those cases when detailed clinical phenotyping is not possible. Once the molecular diagnosis is confirmed in a family, it is necessary to conduct a thorough re-evaluation of the patients' specific clinical phenotypes in order to establish a clear genotype-phenotype correlation.© 2023 Muthaffar, Abdulkareem, Ashi and Naseer."

The MEGD(H)EL syndrome is characterized by (3-methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness-dystonia, [hepatopathy], encephalopathy, and Leigh-like syndrome). Biochemical abnormalities: elevated urinary 3 - metilglutaconic and 3-metilglutaric acids, high lactate and alanine in serum. Diagnosis is confirmed when biallelic pathogenic variants in SERAC1 gene are found. Brain MRI: basal ganglia lesions and generalized atrophy. Results/Case report - A 30-year-old patient with a moderate intellectual disability, developed, since the age of 25, a progressive loss of previous capacities (hand dexterity, oral language), and later subacute generalized dystonic features. Currently he has spastic tetraparesis, dystonia, scoliosis and autistic behavior, with bilateral basal ganglia lesions on brain MRI. Genetic study revealed biallelic pathogenic variants in SERAC1 gene, confirm MEGD(H)EL. A 73 years old patient with cognitive impairment and progressive spastic tetraparesis had multiple periventricular T2 hyperintense lesions.

Targeted NGS of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial diseases was performed in a patient belonging to a consanguineous Tunisian family with LS and revealed a homozygous c.1264 A > G (p.T422A) variant in SLC19A3. Molecular docking revealed that the p.T422A aa change is located at a key position interacting with vitB1 and causes conformational changes compromising vitB1 import. We further disclosed decreased plasma antioxidant activities of CAT, SOD and GSH enzymes, and a 42% decrease of the mtDNA copy number in patient blood.Altogether, our results disclose that the c.1264 A > G (p.T422A) variant in SLC19A3 affects vitB1 transport, induces a mtDNA depletion and reduces the expression level of oxidative stress enzymes, altogether contributing to the LS phenotype of the patient.© 2023.

Methods. We searched the Quarantine Activity Reporting System (QARS) database for travelers with inbound international or domestic air travel, a positive SARS-CoV-2 lab result, and a surveillance categorization of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported during January 2020 to December 2021. Travelers were categorized as infectious during travel if they had arrival dates from 2 days before to 10 days after symptom onset or a positive viral test. Results. We identified 80 715 persons meeting our inclusion criteria; 67 445 persons (83.6%) had at least 1 symptom reported. Of 67 445 symptomatic passengers, 43 884 (65.1%) reported an initial symptom onset date after their flight arrival date. The number of infectious travelers mirrored the overall number of US SARS-CoV-2 cases. Conclusions. Most travelers in the study were asymptomatic during travel, and therefore unknowingly traveled while infectious.

It is most often caused by one of the hypervirulent strains, which are capable of causing metastatic infection. This occurs most commonly in Asia in patients without hepatobiliary disease; however, it is becoming increasingly recognized in North America. CASE REPORT We report a previously healthy man in his 50s who presented to hospital with 3 weeks of fever, chills, and mild abdominal pain following a minor motor vehicle collision. Ultrasound and computed tomography of his abdomen revealed a large multi-loculated liver abscess. This was drained percutaneously and grew a hypervirulent strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae known to cause metastatic infection. His blood cultures were negative. In addition to percutaneous drainage, he was treated with 8 weeks of antimicrobial therapy. Fortunately, he did not develop evidence of metastatic infection despite the hypervirulent strain. Etiology of the abscess was not clearly identified; however, it was speculated that the motor vehicle collision could have led to its development through gut translocation. CONCLUSIONS Presentation of Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscesses is often nonspecific, and clinicians must have a high index of suspicion in order to ensure rapid diagnosis and treatment. Delay in diagnosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and thus it is an important entity for clinicians to be aware of, especially as it becomes more prevalent in North American populations. Additionally, it is important that physicians are aware of the hypervirulent strains and screen patients clinically for evidence of metastatic infection."

Mutations in the four genes SDHA, B, C,and D have been reported resulting in diverse clinical presentations. The vast majority of clinically affected individuals reported in the literature harbor genetic variants within the SDHA gene and present with a Leigh syndrome phenotype, clinically defined as a subacute necrotizing encephalopathy.Herein, we report the first case of a 7-year-old child who was diagnosed as having succinate dehydrogenase deficiency. The affected child presented at 1 year of age with encephalopathy and developmental regression following viral illnesses. MRI changes supported a clinical diagnosis of Leigh syndrome and c.1328C>Q and c.872A>C SDHA variants were identified as compound heterozygous. Mitochondrial cocktail treatment including L-carnitine, riboflavin, thiamine, biotin, and ubiquinone was started. Mild clinical improvement was observed after treatment. He is now unable to walk and speak. The second patient, a 21-year-old woman, presented with generalized muscle weakness, easy fatigability, and cardiomyopathy. Investigations revealed increased lactate level of 67.4 mg/dL (4.5-19.8) with repeatedly increased plasma alanine levels 1,272 µmol/L (200-579). We administered carnitine, coenzyme, riboflavin, and thiamine for empirical therapy with the suspicion of mitochondrial disease. Clinical exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants NM_004168.4:c.1945_1946del (p.Leu649GlufsTer4) at exon 15 of the SDHA gene and NM_004168.4:c.1909-12_1909-11del at intron 14 of SDHA gene.There are several very different presentations including Leigh syndrome, epileptic encephalopathy, and cardiomyopathy. Some cases present following viral illness; this feature is not specific to mitochondrial complex II deficiency and occurs in many other mitochondrial disease presentations. There is no cure for complex II deficiency, though some reported patients showed clinical improvement following riboflavin therapy. Riboflavin is not the only therapeutic intervention that is available to patients with an isolated complex II deficiency and various other compounds have shown promise in the treatment of symptoms, including L-carnitine and ubiquinone.

The approach included a review of clinical, neuroimaging, laboratory, and genetic data, followed by an unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis looking for sources of phenotype variability in MELAS. Subsequently, experts identified """"victory-variables"""" that best differentiated MELAS cohort clusters.Thirty-five patients with a diagnosis of mitochondrial DNA-based MELAS (median age, 12 years; interquartile range, 7-24 years; 24 female) were eligible for this study. Fifty-three discrete variables were evaluated by an unsupervised cluster analysis, which revealed that two distinct phenotypes exist among patients with MELAS. After experts reviewed the variables, they selected 8 victory-variables with the greatest impact in determining the MELAS subgroups: developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, vision loss in the first strokelike episode, Leigh syndrome overlap, age at the first strokelike episode, cortical lesion size, regional brain distribution of lesions, and genetic groups. Ultimately, 2-step differentiating criteria were defined to classify atypical MELAS.We identified 2 distinct patterns of MELAS: classic MELAS and atypical MELAS. Recognizing different patterns in MELAS presentations will enable clinical and research care teams to better understand the natural history and prognosis of MELAS and identify the best candidates for specific therapeutic interventions.© 2023 by American Journal of Neuroradiology."

We describe three Polish patients, a 9-year-old boy, and female and male siblings, aged 17 and 11 years, with clinical and biochemical manifestations of LS. Exome sequencing (ES) identified a homozygous pathogenic variant in DNAJC30 c.152A>G, p.(Tyr51Cys) in the 9-year-old boy.

The clinical presentation of Leigh's syndrome can vary significantly. However, in the majority of cases, it usually presents as a progressive neurological disease involving motor and cognitive development. It is common to see signs and symptoms of the midbrain and brainstem involvement. Limited data are present on the brain processes occurring in Leigh's syndrome which can be attributed to fatal respiratory failure. Raised lactate levels in the blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid are noted. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings such as necrotic, symmetrical lesions in the BG/brain stem are helpful in arriving at the diagnosis of Leigh's syndrome. It's of utmost importance to determine whether fatal respiratory failure can be predicted based on clinical characteristics and findings on MRI. In our report, we presented 3 cases from rural India, including a 2-year-old male child presenting with UMN lesion signs, a 3-month-old female infant with delayed developmental milestones with lab results suggestive of Leigh's disease, and a 12-year-old female child with epistaxis and generalized weakness. As discussed above, all 3 cases presented differently with a variety of signs and symptoms and would have gone undiagnosed without the use of brain imaging. The study concluded with the impression that while MRI is essential to the initial diagnosis of Leigh's disease, MRI alone cannot be used to predict fatal respiratory failure in patients with Leigh's disease.

A targeted next-generation sequencing analysis related to mitochondrial disease revealed a missense variant (NM_152416.4:c.371T > C; p.Ile124Thr) and a frameshift variant (NM_152416.4:c.233_242del; p.Leu78GInfs*10) inherited biparentally. The proband underwent physical therapy and nutrient cocktail therapy, but his physical impairment gradually worsened.Copyright © 2022 Kim, Lee and Jang."

However, data about the characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of epilepsy in maternally inherited Leigh syndrome (MILS) are limited. A four-year-old boy with sporadic MILS developed epilepsy at the age of five months.

The patient presented with absences, and focal and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Despite treatment with anti-seizure drugs such as vigabatrin, lamotrigine, clonazepam, diazepam, clobazam, and phenobarbital, seizure control was insufficient, and seizures became intractable. The patient died after recurrent aspiration, pneumonia, and sepsis. In conclusion, the m.8993T>G variant can occur sporadically, and m.8993T>G carriers with MILS may develop epilepsy as the disease progresses.

CT of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis showed a suspicious mass in the oesophago-gastric junction with a lytic lesion on S1-S2 sacrum. A subsequent upper GI endoscopy revealed two raised, ulcerated tumours on the lesser curvature of the stomach. By the time an MRI of the whole spine was done which revealed multiple metastases involving thoracic, lumbar and sacral skeleton, she had developed leg weakness and paraesthesias, consistent with the imaging findings. A positron emission tomography/CT scan further confirmed the above findings. The initial working diagnosis was primary GI tumour with bony metastases. However, she was later referred to the haematology team after the immunohistochemistry of the tumour showed that it was of a plasma cell origin (CD138 positive) associated with lambda light chain deposits. Serum-free light chain showed a raised lambda light chain of 272 mg/L and kappa light chain of 11.3 mg/L and involved/uninvolved light chain ratio of 24. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed a plasma cell myeloma with moderate disease burden. Monoclonal lambda chains were demonstrated on immunofixation but negative on serum protein electrophoresis and hence a diagnosis of oligosecretory myeloma with GI involvement was made. Subsequent management involved physiotherapy, pain management and chemotherapy, where this woman was commenced on Velcade (generically known as bortezomib), thalidomide and dexamethasone and she continued to experience clinical and biochemical improvement.© BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2022.

We estimated the stability of the mutant protein using a mutation cutoff scanning matrix and found reductions in Gibbs free energy (-0.623 kcal/mol for p.D119E and -0.813 kcal/mol for p.A204V), indicating that the mutations led to an unstable protein structure.

Magnetic resonance imaging also revealed lesions in bilateral white matter as well as symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia and brain stem. The patient was diagnosed with LS. The patient was treated with vitamin C, vitamin D, and adenosine-triphosphate. The patient died within 2 mo of hospital admission.LS can present in both infants and older children with different phenotypes.©The Author(s) 2021. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

PDHC activity in peripheral blood leukocytes and a corresponding gene analysis were subsequently undertaken. Sodium pyruvate 1-13 C was used for the analysis of PDHC activity in peripheral leukocytes. The genes encoding PDHC were then scanned for mutations.The results showed that the corresponding PDHC activity was dramatically decreased to 10.5 nmol/h/mg protein as compared with that of healthy controls (124.6 ± 7.1 nmol/h/mg). The ratio of PDHC to citrate synthase was 2.1% (control: 425.3 ± 27.1).

Methods: The clinical data, laboratory tests, neuroimaging and gene results of one patient diagnosed as MoCD-B at Beijing Children's Hospital and Hebei Children's Hospital in December 2018 were collected. Related literature was searched and reviewed at Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and PubMed (up to September 2020) by using terms """"MOCS2"""" """"molybdenum cofactor deficiency"""" """"Leigh-like syndrome,MOCS2"""" """"molybdenum cofactor deficiency, Leigh-like syndrome"""". The phenotypes and genotypes of MoCD-B were summarized. Results: A 7 months and 14 days old boy with the chief complaint of """"cough for 6 days, abnormal posture for 4 days and fever for 2 days"""" was admitted to Hebei Children' Hospital on December 2018. His abnormal posture presented as opisthotonos accompanied with dysphagia, without seizures. His previous psychomotor development was described as normal. He was born at term after an uneventful pregnancy to non-consanguineous parents. Blood test showed a slightly increased lactic acid and a significantly decreased uric acid. Urine metabolism test showed an obviously increased xanthine and hypoxanthine. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense signal on T2 weighted image and fluid attenuated inversion recovery in bilateral globus pallidus and pedunculus cerebri. The patient was diagnosed with Leigh-like syndrome. No obvious improvement was achieved after cocktail therapy and symptomatic treatment. The whole exome sequencing showed that the patient carried a homozygous variant of MOCS2 gene, c.19G>T(p.Val7Phe), which was a previously reported pathogenic site in the literature and could cause MoCD-B. His parents carried a heterozygous variant respectively. A total of 41 MoCD-B cases with MOCS2 gene variants were collected through literature review and our study, among which 30 cases had full medical records. The onset ages of 23 (77%) cases were in neonate, manifesting with severe encephalopathy, including neonatal-onset intractable seizures, developmental delay, laboratory abnormalities included very low levels of serum and urinary uric acid, increased urinary levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine. Cranial imaging showed cerebral atrophy, cystic encephalomalacia, etc. The onset ages of 7 patients varied from 5 months to 23 years. Four cases had normal psychomotor development before disease onset. Neurological disorders appeared acutely or exacerbated after external triggers and all of them had basal ganglia involvement. Among the 30 cases, 3 cases had a relatively milder phenotype with the ability of brief communication and walking without or with support. Conclusions: Molybdenum cofactor deficiency is a rare disease. Most cases had severe phenotypes and poor outcomes, but some cases may have mild phenotype. MoCD-B caused by MOCS2 gene variants may manifest as Leigh-like syndrome with a normal psychomotor development before the trigger of infection strike. Hypouricemia, xanthinuria and hypoxanthinuria can be indicators of the disease. The presence of MOCS2 gene variants would confirm a final diagnosis."

Here we show that chronic infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to viral evolution and reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies in an immunosuppressed individual treated with convalescent plasma, by generating whole-genome ultra-deep sequences for 23 time points that span 101 days and using in vitro techniques to characterize the mutations revealed by sequencing. There was little change in the overall structure of the viral population after two courses of remdesivir during the first 57 days. However, after convalescent plasma therapy, we observed large, dynamic shifts in the viral population, with the emergence of a dominant viral strain that contained a substitution (D796H) in the S2 subunit and a deletion (ΔH69/ΔV70) in the S1 N-terminal domain of the spike protein. As passively transferred serum antibodies diminished, viruses with the escape genotype were reduced in frequency, before returning during a final, unsuccessful course of convalescent plasma treatment. In vitro, the spike double mutant bearing both ΔH69/ΔV70 and D796H conferred modestly decreased sensitivity to convalescent plasma, while maintaining infectivity levels that were similar to the wild-type virus.The spike substitution mutant D796H appeared to be the main contributor to the decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, but this mutation resulted in an infectivity defect. The spike deletion mutant ΔH69/ΔV70 had a twofold higher level of infectivity than wild-type SARS-CoV-2, possibly compensating for the reduced infectivity of the D796H mutation. These data reveal strong selection on SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma therapy, which is associated with the emergence of viral variants that show evidence of reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies in immunosuppressed individuals."

Further, cysteamine may detoxify the toxic metabolites themselves and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a potent antioxidant preventing neurological affect. Herein, we report the therapeutic effects of dietary therapy, cysteamine, and NAC in two siblings with ECHS1D, including their clinical, neuroradiological, and chemical aspects.The elder sister was the proband and was diagnosed as LS at 13 months of age. Gene analysis identified compound heterozygous ECHS1 mutations. Her psychomotor development was regressed, and she became bedridden. At 4 years old she started a low protein diet (LPD), but with no obvious neurological change. The younger brother was confirmed early with ECHS1D and received cysteamine and NAC treatment from 5 months of age, which could not prevent him developing LS at 7 months of age. Thus, we started a LPD at 14 months of age, with which he regained his ability to roll over, then we proceeded to a valine-restricted diet. The brain magnetic resonance image hyperintensity was diminished, and the lactate peak on magnetic resonance spectroscopy decreased. His neurological outcome is better than his elder sister.

We further employed molecular genetic analyses to detect mtDNA mutation in the proband and his mother. And then a clinical and neuroimaging follow-up was performed.This patient was a 25-year-old male, who developed exercise intolerance since the age of 6. At age 10, he suffered from acute episodes of hemianopia, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed occipital stroke-like lesions and cranial magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) revealed a lactate peak corresponding to the lesion. After that the patient presented slowly progressive psychomotor decline. He had myoclonic seizures and cerebellar ataxia since the age of 12. At age 21, he was admitted to our hospital because of confusion and cranial MRI revealed symmetrical lesions in bilateral posterior putamen, thalami and midbrain. Then repeated MRI showed progression of original lesions and new frontal multiple stroke-like lesions. Symptomatic and rehabilitation treatment relieved his condition. Follow-up cranial MRI at age 24 showed the lesions in basal ganglia and thalami diminished, and the midbrain lesions even completely vanished. Muscle pathology indicated the presence of numerous scattered ragged-red fibers (RRF), suggestive of a mitochondrial disorder.

It is an autosomal recessive neurogenetic OXPHOS disorder, phenotypically distinct from other types of Leigh syndrome, with a carrier frequency up to 1:23 and an incidence of 1:2063 in the Saguenay-Lac-St Jean region of Quebec. Recently, LSFC has also been reported outside the French-Canadian population.We report a male Italian (Sicilian) child, born preterm at 28 + 6/7 weeks gestation, carrying a novel LRPPRC compound heterozygous mutation, with facial dysmorphisms, neonatal hypotonia, non-epileptic paroxysmal motor phenomena, and absent sucking-swallowing-breathing coordination requiring, at 4.5 months, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. At 5 months brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed diffuse cortical atrophy, hypoplasia of corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and unfolded hippocampi. Both auditory and visual evoked potentials were pathological. In the following months Video EEG confirmed the persistence of sporadic non epileptic motor phenomena. No episode of metabolic decompensation, acidosis or ketosis, frequently observed in LSFC has been reported. Actually, aged 14 months corrected age for prematurity, the child shows a severe global developmental delay. Metabolic investigations and array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) results were normal. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) found a compound heterozygous mutation in the LRPPRC gene, c.1921-7A > G and c.2056A > G (p.Ile686Val), splicing-site and missense variants, inherited from the mother and the father, respectively.We first characterized the clinical and molecular features of a novel LRPPRC variant in a male Sicilian child with early onset encephalopathy and psychomotor impairment. Our patient showed a phenotype characterized by a severe neurodevelopmental delay and absence of metabolic decompensation attributable to a probable residual enzymatic activity. LRPPRC is a rare cause of metabolic encephalopathy outside of Québec. Our patient adds to and broaden the spectrum of LSFC phenotypes. WES analysis is a pivotal genetic test and should be performed in infants and children with hypotonia and developmental delay in whom metabolic investigations and aCGH are normal."

Targeted next-generation sequencing of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA was used to identify the causative mutations. The patients presented with subacute encephalopathy between the ages of 1-27 months. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed abnormalities in the basal ganglia, indicating Leigh syndrome.

In family A, following a brief illness, a 4-year-old girl presented comatose with lactic acidosis and multiorgan failure. After stabilization, she remained comatose, hypotonic, had neurostorming episodes, elevated lactate, and Leigh-like lesions on brain imaging. She died shortly after.

Both patients were homozygous for c.637G > A, which we identified as a founder mutation in the Lehrerleut Hutterite with a carrier frequency of 1 in 13. The resulting p.Glu213Lys change disrupts hydrogen bonding with neighboring residues, resulting in severely reduced SQOR protein and enzyme activity, whereas sulfide generating enzyme levels were unchanged. In family B, a boy had episodes of encephalopathy and basal ganglia lesions. He was homozygous for c.446delT and had severely reduced fibroblast SQOR enzyme activity and protein levels. SQOR dysfunction can result in hydrogen sulfide accumulation, which, consistent with its known toxicity, inhibits complex IV resulting in energy failure.

It is characterized by symmetrical lesions found on neuroimaging in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem and by a loss of motor skills and delayed developmental milestones. Genetic diagnosis of Leigh syndrome is complicated on account of the vast genetic heterogeneity with >75 candidate disease-associated genes having been reported to date. Candidate genes are still emerging, being identified when """"omics"""" tools (genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics) are applied to manipulated cell lines and cohorts of clinically characterized individuals who lack a genetic diagnosis. NDUFAF8 is one such protein; it has been found to interact with the well-characterized complex I (CI) assembly factor NDUFAF5 in a large-scale protein-protein interaction screen. Diagnostic next-generation sequencing has identified three unrelated pediatric subjects, each with a clinical diagnosis of Leigh syndrome, who harbor bi-allelic pathogenic variants in NDUFAF8. These variants include a recurrent splicing variant that was initially overlooked due to its deep-intronic location. Subject fibroblasts were found to express a complex I deficiency, and lentiviral transduction with wild-type NDUFAF8-cDNA ameliorated both the assembly defect and the biochemical deficiency. Complexome profiling of subject fibroblasts demonstrated a complex I assembly defect, and the stalled assembly intermediates corroborate the role of NDUFAF8 in early complex I assembly. This report serves to expand the genetic heterogeneity associated with Leigh syndrome and to validate the clinical utility of orphan protein characterization. We also highlight the importance of evaluating intronic sequence when a single, definitively pathogenic variant is identified during diagnostic testing.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We identified a previously reported de novo heterozygous pathogenic splice mutation in PIK3R1 (c.1425 + 1G > A), resulting in the skipping of exon 11 of the p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and causing activated PI3Kδ syndrome type II (APDS2). This explained the phenotype, with the exception of digital vasculitis and C1q deficiency, which have never been described in association with APDS2. No mutations were identified in C1QA, B, or C, their promoter regions, or in any other complement component. Functional studies indicated normal monocytic C1q production and release, suggesting that the observed C1q deficiency was caused by peripheral consumption of C1q. Since C1q deficiency has never been associated with APDS2, we assessed C1q levels in two unrelated patients with genetically confirmed APDS2 and confirmed C1q deficiency in those two cases as well. This observation suggests C1q deficiency to be an inherent but previously unrecognized feature of APDS2. We speculate that the consumption of C1q is driven by increased apoptotic bodies derived from immune cellular senescence, combined with elevated IgM production (both inherent features of APDS2). Secondary C1q deficiency in APDS2 may further contribute to immunodeficiency and could also be associated with inflammatory immune dysregulatory phenotypes, such as the digital vasculitis observed in our case.Copyright © 2019 Hong, Nanthapisal, Omoyinmi, Olbrich, Neth, Speckmann, Lucena, Gilmour, Worth, The Genomics England Research Consortium, Klein, Eleftheriou and Brogan."

The typical pathologic hallmarks are focal, bilateral, and symmetric lesions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, cerebellum, cerebral white matter and spinal cord gray matter, usually with T2WI and FLAIR hyperintensity. The basal ganglia and thalami frequently present with a pattern of cytotoxic edema.

The m.10191T>C mutation in the mitochondrial DNA gene encoding in the respiratory chain complex I (CI) subunit of MTND3 results in the substitution of a highly conserved amino acid (p.Ser45Pro) within the ND3 protein, leading to CI dysfunction and causing a broad clinical spectrum of disorders that includes LS.

The pathophysiology of WMH is not fully understood; however, there is growing evidence to suggest that the development of WMH may be preceded by the BBB disruption in the NAWM.We studied a patient enrolled in the National Institutes of Health Natural History of Stroke Study who was scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after presenting to the emergency room with an acute stroke. After a treatment with IV tPA, she underwent further MRI scanning at 2 h, 24 h, 5 days, 30 days, 90 days, 6 months, and 1-year post stroke. BBB permeability images were generated from the perfusion weighted imaging (PWI) source images. MRIs from each time point were co-registered to track changes in BBB disruption and WMH over time.An 84-year-old woman presented after acute onset right hemiparesis, right-sided numbness and aphasia with an initial NIHSS of 13. MRI showed diffusion restriction in the left frontal lobe and decreased blood flow on perfusion imaging. Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging showed bilateral confluent WMH involving the deep white matter and periventricular regions. She was treated with IV tPA without complication and her NIHSS improved initially to 3 and ultimately to 0. Permeability maps identified multiple regions of chronic BBB disruption remote from the acute stroke, predominantly spanning the junction of WMH and NAWM. The severity of BBB disruption was greatest at 24 h after the stroke but persisted on subsequent MRI scans. Progression of WMH into NAWM over the year of observation was detected bilaterally but was most dramatic in the regions adjacent to the initial stroke.WMH-associated BBB disruption may be exacerbated by an acute stroke, even in the contralateral hemisphere, and can persist for months after the initial event. Transformation of NAWM to WMH may be evident in areas of BBB disruption within a year after the stroke. Further studies are needed to investigate the relationship between chronic BBB disruption and progressive WMH in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease and the potential for acute stroke to trigger or exacerbate the process leading to the development of WMH."

Patients presenting with fluctuating symptoms can appear to have rapidly improving symptoms and thus often go untreated despite the risk of recurrent deficits. MRI carries a higher sensitivity in detecting posterior circulation strokes compared to computed topagraphy, but does not always indicate irreversible injury. Here we present the first description of a stuttering lacune, captured radiographically on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), that was initially averted with the administration of intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), only to return a month later and progress on imaging despite re-administration of tPA. During the first admission, our patient had spontaneous resolution of symptoms with complete reversal on restricted diffusion soon after IV tPA administration. On the second admission, the stuttering symptoms returned as did the same pontine lesion. Although his stuttering lesions lasted for several days, and the pontine lesion did ultimately progress to partial infarction on MRI, he was discharged home without neurologic deficits.

The obtained data showed that the mutation was maternally inherited and accumulated through generations. Even though the heteroplasmy levels of his mother, aunt, cousin 1, and cousin 2 were relatively high (66.81‑91.24%), they remained asymptomatic, indicating that the threshold at which this mutation shows effects is high. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a case of Leigh syndrome in a Vietnamese individual harboring a mtDNA mutation at the 8,993 bp site, and showing a correlation between the heteroplasmy and clinical phenotype. These findings may be useful in helping to improve the clinical diagnosis and treatment of Leigh syndrome."

We studied the exome of a child manifesting with Leigh syndrome at one month of age and progressing to death by the age of 2.4 years, and identified novel compound heterozygous variants in PNPT1, encoding the polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). Expression of the wild type PNPT1 in the subject's myoblasts functionally complemented the defects, and the pathogenicity was further supported by structural predictions and protein and RNA analyses. PNPase is a key enzyme in mitochondrial RNA metabolism, with suggested roles in mitochondrial RNA import and degradation. The variants were predicted to locate in the PNPase active site and disturb the RNA processing activity of the enzyme. The PNPase trimer formation was not affected, but specific RNA processing intermediates derived from mitochondrial transcripts of the ND6 subunit of Complex I, as well as small mRNA fragments, accumulated in the subject's myoblasts. Mitochondrial RNA processing mediated by the degradosome consisting of hSUV3 and PNPase is poorly characterized, and controversy on the role and location of PNPase within human mitochondria exists. Our evidence indicates that PNPase activity is essential for the correct maturation of the ND6 transcripts, and likely for the efficient removal of degradation intermediates. Loss of its activity will result in combined respiratory chain deficiency, and a classic respiratory chain-deficiency-associated disease, Leigh syndrome, indicating an essential role for the enzyme for normal function of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.© The Author 2017.

According to some studies, intravesical botulinum toxin for SCI patients with autonomic dysreflexia has a preventive effect on symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia. However, the usefulness of an intravesical botulinum toxin injection has never been reported for autonomic dysreflexia in an adult patient with chronic cervical SCI, although there has been for one pediatric patient.Findings: A 62-year-old man with chronic cervical SCI had neurogenic bladder due to C6-7 SCI since sustaining a fall in 1980. He presented with an intermittent headache and severe hypertension because of persistent autonomic dysreflexia. His symptoms did not improve with conservative management, and he could not undergo an operation to resect the lung cancer because of his uncontrolled blood pressure. To control his fluctuating blood pressure, he was taken to an operating room to receive an intravesical botulinum toxin injection for refractory bladder spasms. Subsequently, his blood pressure was controlled, and then the lung mass could be surgically removed. His improved condition lasted for more than 6 months.Conclusion: This case suggests that botulinum toxin is a logical treatment option for autonomic dysreflexia as well as neurogenic detrusor overactivity in patients with chronic SCI. Dedicated research is warranted to assess the efficacy of an intravesical botulinum toxin injection, as it was used successfully to stop the symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia in our patient."

Here we report a novel SLC39A8 variant in siblings with features of Leigh-like mitochondrial disease. Two sisters born to consanguineous Lebanese parents had profound developmental delay, dystonia, seizures and failure to thrive. Brain MRI of both siblings identified bilateral basal ganglia hyperintensities on T2-weighted imaging and cerebral atrophy. CSF lactate was elevated in patient 1 and normal in patient 2. Respiratory chain enzymology was only performed on patient 1 and revealed complex IV and II + III activity was low in liver, with elevated complex I activity. Complex IV activity was borderline low in patient 1 muscle and pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was reduced. Whole genome sequencing identified a homozygous Chr4(GRCh37):g.103236869C>G; c.338G>C; p.(Cys113Ser) variant in SLC39A8, located in one of eight regions identified by homozygosity mapping. SLC39A8 encodes a manganese and zinc transporter which localises to the cell and mitochondrial membranes. Patient 2 blood and urine manganese levels were undetectably low. Transferrin electrophoresis of patient 2 serum revealed a type II CDG defect. Oral supplementation with galactose and uridine led to improvement of the transferrin isoform pattern within 14 days of treatment initiation. Oral manganese has only recently been added to the treatment. These results suggest SLC39A8 deficiency can cause both a type II CDG and Leigh-like syndrome, possibly via reduced activity of the manganese-dependent enzymes β-galactosyltransferase and mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase."

We developed a new LC-MS/MS based enzyme assay to demonstrate the decreased SCS activity in the siblings with this unique genotype. Both siblings shared bilateral progressive hearing loss, encephalopathy, global developmental delay, generalized myopathy, and dystonia with choreoathetosis. Prior to diagnosis and because of lactic acidosis and low activity of muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), sibling 1 (S1) was placed on dichloroacetate, while sibling 2 (S2) was on a ketogenic diet. S1 developed severe cyclic vomiting refractory to therapy, while S2 developed Leigh syndrome, severe GI dysmotility, intermittent anemia, hypogammaglobulinemia and eventually succumbed to his disorder. The mitochondrial DNA contents in skeletal muscle (SM) were normal in both siblings. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and several mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activities were low or at the low end of the reference range in frozen SM from S1 and/or S2. In contrast, activities of PDC, other mitochondrial enzymes of pyruvate metabolism, ETC and, integrated oxidative phosphorylation, in skin fibroblasts were not significantly impaired. Although we show that propionyl-CoA inhibits PDC, it does not appear to account for decreased PDC activity in SM.

We investigated two adult siblings presenting with features of cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, and hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.

Components of the fission machinery are partly shared between mitochondria and peroxisomes, and inherited defects in two such components (dynamin-related protein (DRP1) and ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 (GDAP1)) have been associated with human disease. Deficiency of a third component (mitochondrial fission factor, MFF) was recently reported in one index patient, rendering MFF another candidate disease gene within the expanding field of mitochondrial and peroxisomal dynamics. Here we investigated three new patients from two families with pathogenic mutations in MFF.The patients underwent clinical examination, brain MRI, and biochemical, cytological and molecular analyses, including exome sequencing.The patients became symptomatic within the first year of life, exhibiting seizures, developmental delay and acquired microcephaly. Dysphagia, spasticity and optic and peripheral neuropathy developed subsequently. Brain MRI showed Leigh-like patterns with bilateral changes of the basal ganglia and subthalamic nucleus, suggestive of impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism. However, activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes were found to be normal in skeletal muscle. Exome sequencing revealed three different biallelic loss-of-function variants in MFF in both index cases. Western blot studies of patient-derived fibroblasts indicated normal content of mitochondria and peroxisomes, whereas immunofluorescence staining revealed elongated mitochondria and peroxisomes. Furthermore, increased mitochondrial branching and an abnormal distribution of fission-mediating DRP1 were observed.Our findings establish MFF loss of function as a cause of disturbed mitochondrial and peroxisomal dynamics associated with early-onset Leigh-like basal ganglia disease. We suggest that, even if laboratory findings are not indicative of mitochondrial or peroxisomal dysfunction, the co-occurrence of optic and/or peripheral neuropathy with seizures warrants genetic testing for MFF mutations.Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Here we review the clinical features and imaging studies of Leigh syndrome and describe the neuroimaging findings in a cohort of 17 children with genetically confirmed Leigh syndrome.

No cerebral white matter lesions were found in any of the 17 children. In concordance with the literature, we found that Leigh syndrome follows a similar pattern of bilateral, symmetrical basal ganglia or brainstem changes. Lesions in Leigh syndrome evolve over time and a lack of visible lesions does not exclude the diagnosis. Reversibility of lesions is seen in some patients, making the continued search for treatment and prevention a priority for clinicians and researchers."

Mutations in nuclear-encoded structural subunits are very rare. In a patient with Leigh-like syndrome presenting with leukodystrophy and severe epilepsy, we identified a homozygous splice site mutation in COX8A, which codes for the ubiquitously expressed isoform of subunit VIII, the smallest nuclear-encoded subunit of complex IV. The mutation, affecting the last nucleotide of intron 1, leads to aberrant splicing, a frame-shift in the highly conserved exon 2, and decreased amount of the COX8A transcript. The loss of the wild-type COX8A protein severely impairs the stability of the entire cytochrome c oxidase enzyme complex and manifests in isolated complex IV deficiency in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts, similar to the frequent c.845_846delCT mutation in the assembly factor SURF1 gene. Stability and activity of complex IV could be rescued in the patient's fibroblasts by lentiviral expression of wild-type COX8A.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency was initially suspected and decreased activity was shown in fibroblasts. Urine tandem mass spectrometry screening showed large increases in the cysteine conjugate of methacrylate previously described in HIBCHD. 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase activity in fibroblasts was below the limit of detection of the enzymatic assay and two novel HIBCH mutations were identified (c.[129dupA];[1033G>A]).

SCEH has a broad substrate specificity and is believed to play an important role in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and in the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. Recently, the first patients with SCEH deficiency have been reported revealing only a defect in valine catabolism. We investigated the role of SCEH in fatty acid and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in four newly identified patients. In addition, because of the Leigh-like presentation, we studied enzymes involved in bioenergetics.Metabolite, enzymatic, protein and genetic analyses were performed in four patients, including two siblings. Palmitate loading studies in fibroblasts were performed to study mitochondrial β-oxidation. In addition, enoyl-CoA hydratase activity was measured with crotonyl-CoA, methacrylyl-CoA, tiglyl-CoA and 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA both in fibroblasts and liver to further study the role of SCEH in different metabolic pathways. Analyses of pyruvate dehydrogenase and respiratory chain complexes were performed in multiple tissues of two patients.All patients were either homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations in the ECHS1 gene, had markedly reduced SCEH enzymatic activity and protein level in fibroblasts. All patients presented with lactic acidosis. The first two patients presented with vacuolating leukoencephalopathy and basal ganglia abnormalities. The third patient showed a slow neurodegenerative condition with global brain atrophy and the fourth patient showed Leigh-like lesions with a single episode of metabolic acidosis. Clinical picture and metabolite analysis were not consistent with a mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation disorder, which was supported by the normal palmitate loading test in fibroblasts. Patient fibroblasts displayed deficient hydratase activity with different substrates tested. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity was markedly reduced in particular in muscle from the most severely affected patients, which was caused by reduced expression of E2 protein, whereas E2 mRNA was increased.Despite its activity towards substrates from different metabolic pathways, SCEH appears to be only crucial in valine metabolism, but not in isoleucine metabolism, and only of limited importance for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. In severely affected patients SCEH deficiency can cause a secondary pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency contributing to the clinical presentation."

It typically presents with a triad of opsoclonus, myoclonus and ataxia, and is most often associated with a tumor or after an infection or vaccination. Around half of all adult cases are paraneoplastic in origin, and isolated case reports include associations with lung, breast and ovarian cancers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-ever reported case of paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome occurring in association with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma.A 50-year-old British Caucasian woman presented with left-sided otalgia and subjective hearing loss. Over the coming weeks she developed subacute confusion and dizziness, leading to recurrent falls. Her clinical examination revealed opsoclonus, myoclonus and signs of cerebellar dysfunction. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left-sided nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which was confirmed on biopsy. A tapering dose of steroids and a five-day course of intravenous immunoglobulins, followed by a combination of chemo-radiotherapy for the nasopharyngeal carcinoma, led to a significant clinical improvement. At six months follow-up she had no signs of focal neurological deficit, apart from the inability to tandem walk. We believe that the typical clinical features, presence of a tumor and response to treatment support a paraneoplastic aetiology.We show that a nasopharyngeal carcinoma can be associated with adult onset opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Both neurologists and otorhinolaryngologists must be aware of such a presentation. Prognosis of the syndrome depends on early and adequate management of the tumor, therefore prompt identification of the syndrome and the underlying tumor is essential."

The mutation 9185T>C in ATP6 gene, associated with Leigh syndrome, was reported in only few families. Motor neuron disease (MND), both clinically and electrophysiologically, was not previously described in association with this mutation. Case Report. 33-year-old male, with family history of mitochondrial disease, presented with cognitive impairment, exercise intolerance, and progressive muscle weakness. Examination revealed global hypotonia, and proximal tetraparesis, without atrophy or fasciculation, pyramidal signs, or sensory symptoms. The laboratory findings revealed an increase of lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio; electromyogram showed chronic neurogenic compromise; muscle biopsy was suggestive of spinal muscular atrophy and mitochondriopathy; genetic study of SMN1 was negative but detected a homoplasmic mutation 9185T>C in ATP6 gene. His younger sister, with the same mutation, had cognitive impairment, ataxia, and muscle weakness. EMG showed axonal peripheral neuropathy. Conclusion. This case is unique because of the benignity and the coexistence of clinical, neurophysiological, and pathological findings suggestive of MND that, although described in mitochondrial disease, have not yet been reported in association with 9185T>C mutation. The present case contributes to the expansion of the phenotypic expressions of this particular mutation."

Episodic encephalopathy type thiamine metabolism dysfunction (OMIM 614458) due to TPK1 mutations is a recently described rare disorder. The mechanism of the disease, its phenotype and treatment are not entirely clear. We present two patients with novel homozygous TPK1 mutations (Patient 1 with p.Ser160Leu and Patient 2 with p.Asp222His). Unlike the previously described phenotype, Patient 2 presented with a Leigh syndrome like non-episodic early-onset global developmental delay, thus extending the phenotypic spectrum of the disorder. We, therefore, propose that TPK deficiency may be a better name for the condition. The two cases help to further refine the neuroradiological features of TPK deficiency and show that MRI changes can be either fleeting or progressive and can affect either white or gray matter. We also show that in some cases lactic acidosis can be absent and 2-ketoglutaric aciduria may be the only biochemical marker. Furthermore, we have established the assays for TPK enzyme activity measurement and thiamine pyrophosphate quantification in frozen muscle and blood. These tests will help to diagnose or confirm the diagnosis of TPK deficiency in a clinical setting. Early thiamine supplementation prevented encephalopathic episodes and improved developmental progression of Patient 1, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of TPK deficiency. We present evidence suggesting that thiamine supplementation may rescue TPK enzyme activity. Lastly, in silico protein structural analysis shows that the p.Ser160Leu mutation is predicted to interfere with TPK dimerization, which may be a novel mechanism for the disease.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

These defects can be caused by either mutations in the mtDNA or mutations in nuclear genes coding for mitochondrial proteins. The underlying pathomechanisms can affect numerous pathways involved in mitochondrial physiology. By whole-exome and candidate gene sequencing, we identified 11 individuals from 9 families carrying compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in GTPBP3, encoding the mitochondrial GTP-binding protein 3. Affected individuals from eight out of nine families presented with combined respiratory chain complex deficiencies in skeletal muscle. Mutations in GTPBP3 are associated with a severe mitochondrial translation defect, consistent with the predicted function of the protein in catalyzing the formation of 5-taurinomethyluridine (τm(5)U) in the anticodon wobble position of five mitochondrial tRNAs. All case subjects presented with lactic acidosis and nine developed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast to individuals with mutations in MTO1, the protein product of which is predicted to participate in the generation of the same modification, most individuals with GTPBP3 mutations developed neurological symptoms and MRI involvement of thalamus, putamen, and brainstem resembling Leigh syndrome.

However, this diagnosis was excluded by HIBCH sequencing and normal enzyme activity. In contrast to HIBCH deficiency, the excretion of 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-carnitine was normal in the children, suggesting deficiency of short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECHS1 gene). This mitochondrial enzyme is active in several metabolic pathways involving fatty acids and amino acids, including valine, and is immediately upstream of HIBCH in the valine pathway. Both children were compound heterozygous for a c.473C > A (p.A158D) missense mutation and a c.414+3G>C splicing mutation in ECHS1. ECHS1 activity was markedly decreased in cultured fibroblasts from both siblings, ECHS1 protein was undetectable by immunoblot analysis and transfection of patient cells with wild-type ECHS1 rescued ECHS1 activity. The highly reactive metabolites methacrylyl-CoA and acryloyl-CoA accumulate in deficiencies of both ECHS1 and HIBCH and are probably responsible for the brain pathology in both disorders. Deficiency of ECHS1 or HIBCH should be considered in children with Leigh disease. Urine metabolite testing can detect and distinguish between these two disorders.© The Author (2014).

Physical and auxiliary examinations demonstrated that a series of changes including white matter lesions of magnetic resonance imaging, peripheral neuropathy with high muscle tension and hyperreflexia of limbs pointed to the diagnosis of leukodystrophy, with what can't explain the high levels of lactate and creatine kinase. Spontaneously, genetic analysis covered known leukodystrophy and mitochondrial genes were adapted for this child and his parents. Results showed the child was compound heterozygous mutation (c.278A > G; c.247G > A) within exon 2 in the NDUFAF1 gene, his parents carried a heterozygous mutation each. The authors report a case of leukodystrophy associated with mitochondrial complex I deficiency due to a novel mutation in the NDUFAF1 gene. This is the first report that NDUFAF1 mutations cause leukodystrophy."

Of 11 individuals identified with variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia, we were able to determine the genetic aetiology in eight patients and delineate the clinical and biochemical phenotypes. Mutations were identified in the genes for lipoate synthase (LIAS), BolA type 3 (BOLA3), and a novel gene glutaredoxin 5 (GLRX5). Patients with GLRX5-associated variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia had normal development with childhood-onset spastic paraplegia, spinal lesion, and optic atrophy. Clinical features of BOLA3-associated variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia include severe neurodegeneration after a period of normal development. Additional features include leukodystrophy, cardiomyopathy and optic atrophy. Patients with lipoate synthase-deficient variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia varied in severity from mild static encephalopathy to Leigh disease and cortical involvement. All patients had high serum and borderline elevated cerebrospinal fluid glycine and cerebrospinal fluid:plasma glycine ratio, and deficient glycine cleavage enzyme activity. They had low pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity but most did not have lactic acidosis. Patients were deficient in lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins. There were minimal and inconsistent changes in cellular iron handling, and respiratory chain activity was unaffected. Identified mutations were phylogenetically conserved, and transfection with native genes corrected the biochemical deficiency proving pathogenicity. Treatments of cells with lipoate and with mitochondrially-targeted lipoate were unsuccessful at correcting the deficiency. The recognition of variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia is important for physicians evaluating patients with abnormalities in glycine as this will affect the genetic causation and genetic counselling, and provide prognostic information on the expected phenotypic course."

Impaired biosynthesis of iron-sulphur clusters and lipoic acid can lead to pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHc) deficiency in addition to multiple RC deficiencies, known as the multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome.Two brothers born to distantly related Pakistani parents presenting in early infancy with a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, associated with basal ganglia changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging, were investigated for suspected Leigh-like mitochondrial disease. The index case had deficiencies of multiple RC enzymes and PDHc in skeletal muscle and fibroblasts respectively, but these were normal in his younger brother. The observation of persistently elevated hydroxy-C4-carnitine levels in the younger brother led to suspicion of HIBCH deficiency, which was investigated by biochemical assay in cultured skin fibroblasts and molecular genetic analysis.Specific spectrophotometric enzyme assay revealed HIBCH activity to be below detectable limits in cultured skin fibroblasts from both brothers. Direct Sanger sequence analysis demonstrated a novel homozygous pathogenic missense mutation c.950G <A; p.Gly317Glu in the HIBCH gene, which segregated with infantile-onset neurodegeneration within the family.HIBCH deficiency, a disorder of valine catabolism, is a novel cause of the multiple mitochondrial dysfunctions syndrome, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with multiple RC deficiencies and/or pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency."

Western blot analysis in patient's fibroblasts showed a complete absence of SERAC1 that was consistent with the prediction of a truncated protein and supports the pathogenic role of the mutation. During the course of this project a parallel study identified mutations in SERAC1 as the genetic cause of the disease in 15 patients with MEGDEL syndrome, which was compatible with the clinical and biochemical phenotypes of the patient described here. In addition, our patient developed microcephaly and optic atrophy, two features not previously reported in MEGDEL syndrome. We highlight the usefulness of exome sequencing to reveal the genetic bases of human rare diseases even if only one affected individual is available.Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Patients manifest acute episodes of encephalopathy; symmetric lesions in the cortex, basal ganglia, thalami or periaqueductal gray matter, and a dramatic response to biotin or thiamine. We report a 30-day-old patient with mutations in the SLC19A3 gene who presented with acute encephalopathy and increased level of lactate in the blood (8.6 mmol/L) and cerebrospinal fluid (7.12 mmol/L), a high excretion of α-ketoglutarate in the urine, and increased concentrations of the branched-chain amino acids leucine and isoleucine in the plasma. MRI detected bilateral and symmetric cortico-subcortical lesions involving the perirolandic area, bilateral putamina, and medial thalami. Some lesions showed low apparent diffusion coefficient values suggesting an acute evolution; others had high values likely to be subacute or chronic, most likely related to the perinatal period. After treatment with thiamine and biotin, irritability and opisthotonus disappeared, and the patient recovered consciousness. Biochemical disturbances also disappeared within 48 hours. After discontinuing biotin, the patient remained stable for 6 months on thiamine supplementation (20 mg/kg/day). The examination revealed subtle signs of neurologic sequelae, and MRI showed necrotic changes and volume loss in some affected areas. Our observations suggest that patients with thiamine transporter 2 deficiency may be vulnerable to metabolic decompensation during the perinatal period, when energy demands are high. Thiamine defects should be excluded in newborns and infants with lactic acidosis because prognosis largely depends on the time from diagnosis to thiamine supplementation."

Until now, mutations in more than 35 genes have been reported to cause Leigh syndrome, indicating an extreme genetic heterogeneity for this disorder, but still only explaining part of the cases. The possibility of whole exome sequencing enables not only mutation detection in known candidate genes, but also the identification of new genes associated with Leigh syndrome in small families and isolated cases. Exome sequencing was combined with homozygosity mapping to identify the genetic defect in a Moroccan family with fatal Leigh syndrome in early childhood and specific magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in the brain. We detected a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.20C>A; p.Ser7Ter) in the thiamine transporter SLC19A3. In vivo overexpression of wild-type SLC19A3 showed an increased thiamine uptake, whereas overexpression of mutant SLC19A3 did not, confirming that the mutation results in an absent or non-functional protein. Seventeen additional patients with Leigh syndrome were screened for mutations in SLC19A3 using conventional Sanger sequencing. Two unrelated patients, both from Moroccan origin and one from consanguineous parents, were homozygous for the same p.Ser7Ter mutation. One of these patients showed the same MRI abnormalities as the patients from the first family. Strikingly, patients receiving thiamine had an improved life-expectancy. One patient in the third family deteriorated upon interruption of the thiamine treatment and recovered after reinitiating. Although unrelated, all patients came from the province Al Hoceima in Northern Morocco. Based on the recombination events the mutation was estimated to have occurred 1250-1750 years ago. Our data shows that SLC19A3 is a new candidate for mutation screening in patients with Leigh syndrome, who might benefit from high doses of thiamine and/or biotin. Especially, Moroccan patients with Leigh syndrome should be tested for the c.20C>A founder mutation in SLC19A3."

Mutations in SDHA and SDHAF1 (assembly factor) have been found in patients with CII deficiency and a mitochondrial phenotype. We present a patient with CII deficiency with a previously undescribed phenotype of dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, failure to thrive, hypotonia, and developmental delay. Also, a comprehensive review of 36 cases published in the literature was undertaken. The results show that CII deficiency has a variable phenotype with no correlation with residual complex activity in muscle although the phenotype and enzyme activities are comparable within a family. For some, the condition was fatal in infancy, others had multisystem involvement and some had onset in adulthood with mild symptoms and normal cognition. Neurological involvement is most commonly observed and brain imaging commonly shows leukoencephalopathy, Leigh syndrome, or cerebellar atrophy. Mutations in SDHAF1 are associated with leukoencephalopathy. Other organ systems like heart, muscle, and eyes are only involved in about 50% of the cases but cardiomyopathy is associated with high mortality and morbidity.

In an attempt to expand the repertoire of known mutations accounting for LS, we describe the clinical, radiological, biochemical and molecular data of six patients with LS found to have novel mutations in two complex I subunits (NDUFV1 and NDUFS2). Two siblings were homozygous for the previously undescribed R386C mutation in NDUFV1, one patient was a compound heterozygote for the R386C mutation in NDUFV1 and a frameshift mutation in the same gene, one patient was a compound heterozygote for the R88G and R199P mutations in NDUFV1, and two siblings were compound heterozygotes for an undescribed E104A mutation in NDUFS2. After the novel mutations were identified, we employed prediction models using protein conservation analysis (SIFT, PolyPhen and UCSC genome browser) to determine pathogenicity. The R386C, R88G, R199P, and E104A mutations were found to be likely pathogenic, and thus presumably account for the LS phenotype.

Ophthalmoplegia is often accompanied by other neurological deficits such as ataxia and areflexia that characterize MFS. Although MFS is a clinical diagnosis, serological confirmation is possible by identifying the anti-GQ1b antibody found in most of the affected patients. We report a patient with MFS who presented with clinical signs suggestive of ocular myasthenia gravis but in whom the correct diagnosis was made on the basis of serological testing for the anti-GQ1b antibody. CASE REPORT.: An 81-year-old white man presented with an acute onset of diplopia after a mild gastrointestinal illness. Clinical examination revealed complete bilateral external ophthalmoplegia and left-sided ptosis. He developed more marked bilateral ptosis, left greater than right, with prolonged attempted upgaze. He was also noted to have a Cogan lid twitch. Same day evaluation by a neuro-ophthalmologist revealed mild left-sided facial and bilateral orbicularis oculi weakness. He had no limb ataxia but exhibited a slightly wide-based gait with difficulty walking heel-to-toe. A provisional diagnosis of ocular myasthenia gravis was made, and anticholinesterase inhibitor therapy was initiated. However, his symptoms did not improve, and serological testing was positive for the anti-GQ1b immunoglobulin G antibody, supporting a diagnosis of MFS. CONCLUSIONS.: Although the predominant ophthalmic feature of MFS is complete bilateral external ophthalmoplegia, it should be recognized that MFS has variable associations with lid and pupillary dysfunction. Such confounding neuro-ophthalmic features require a thorough history, neurological examination, neuroimaging, and serological testing for the anti-GQ1b antibody to arrive at a diagnosis of MFS."

Fetal hypokinesia, secondary to a variety of genetic conditions, neuromuscular disorders, and environmental agents, is associated with contractures. In order to increase our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum associated with SURF 1 deficiency, a common cause of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex IV deficiency and Leigh syndrome, we describe a now 6-year-old boy who presented in the neonatal period with amyoplasia congenita. His development was normal until age 10.5 months, at which time he developed severe hypotonia and choreoathetosis following an episode of viral gastroenteritis. Following the onset of neurological symptoms, he gradually developed severe kyphosis and lower limb contractures. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels were elevated and head imaging showed characteristic features of Leigh syndrome. He was found to harbor two pathogenic heterozygous mutations in the SURF 1 gene. In this case, mitochondrial dysfunction and the resultant energy deficiency may have played a role in causing abnormal neuronal development during embryogenesis, causing arthrogryposis. A variety of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiencies have been associated with contractures of varying severity. Therefore, mitochondrial disorders should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal arthrogryposis, especially if other characteristic findings such as lactic acidemia or basal ganglia abnormalities are present.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

The extensive clinical and genetic heterogeneity of these disorders due to a broad variety of mutations in several hundreds of candidate genes, encoded by either the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA), impedes a straightforward genetic diagnosis. A new disease gene is presented here, identified in a single Kurdish patient born from consanguineous parents with neonatally fatal Leigh syndrome and complex I deficiency.Using homozygosity mapping and subsequent positional candidate gene analysis, a total region of 255.8 Mb containing 136 possible mitochondrial genes was identified. A pathogenic mutation was found in the complex I subunit encoding the NDUFA9 gene, changing a highly conserved arginine at position 321 to proline. This is the first disease-causing mutation ever reported for NDUFA9. Complex I activity was restored in fibroblasts of the patient by lentiviral transduction with wild type but not mutant NDUFA9, confirming that the mutation causes the complex I deficiency and related disease.The data show that homozygosity mapping and candidate gene analysis remain an efficient way to detect mutations even in small consanguineous pedigrees with OXPHOS deficiency, especially when the enzyme deficiency in fibroblasts allows appropriate candidate gene selection and functional complementation."

Three candidate genes were identified, and in one of the genes, NDUFA12, a homozygous c.178C→T mutation leading to a premature stop codon (p.Arg60X) was found. Western blot analysis showed absence of NDUFA12 protein in patient fibroblasts and functional complementation by a baculovirus system showed restoration of complex I activity.NDUFA12 mutations are apparently not a frequent cause of complex I deficiency, since mutations were not found by screening altogether 122 complex I deficient patients in two different studies. NDUFA12 encodes an accessory subunit of complex I and is a paralogue of NDUFAF2. Despite the complete absence of NDUFA12 protein, a fully assembled and enzymatically active complex I could be found, albeit in reduced amounts. This suggests that NDUFA12 is required either at a late step in the assembly of complex I, or in the stability of complex I."

PDHA1 gene was analysed by direct sequencing. In patient 1, the initial hypotonia with psychomotor retardation was observed since early infancy. The child gradually showed symptoms of spasticity and arrest of psychomotor development. In patient 2, the disease manifested by seizures and hyporeflexia in the toddler age. The diagnosis was confirmed at the age of seven years after attacks of dystonia and clinical manifestation of myopathy with normal mental development. Brain MRI of both patients revealed lesions typical of Leigh syndrome. Enzymatic analyses revealed PDHc deficiency in isolated lymphocytes in the first but not in the second patient. The direct measurement of PDH E1-subunit revealed deficiency in this individual. In patient 1, a novel hemizigous mutation c.857C>T (Pro250Leu) was detected in the X-linked PDHA1 gene.

The clinical course of the disease was as follows: in the neonatal period transient adaptation troubles; at 4-5 mo failure to thrive and hypotonia; at 13 mo: extrapyramidal symptoms, sensorineural deafness, Leigh syndrome on MRI, pigmentary degeneration of retina, episodes of respiratory alkalosis, increased lactate in plasma, urine and brain, and increased excretion of 3-MGCA. Mitochondrial encephalopathy was suspected and muscle biopsy performed. Only mild lipid accumulation was found by muscle histopathology and histochemistry.

The in-gel activity assay in the patient's muscle confirmed a combined defect of OXPHOS, particularly indicating suppression of mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V) activity. Measurements of functional mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters in the patient's fibroblasts revealed a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. At the same time, a significant increase of ROS production (cytosolic and mitochondrial superoxide and H2O2) with signs of protein damage (protein carbonylation), and decreased antioxidant defence (SOD1 and SOD2) were observed. Additionally, the catalase amount was surprisingly low in comparison with healthy control and other reference 3-MGCA cases (Barth syndrome).(1) the natural history of the disease in the presented patient confirms the existence of previously reported clinical phenotype of MEGDEL (2) antioxidant defence impairment due to abnormal catalase metabolism/transport may characterize an unknown basic defect which led to the development of MEGDEL association."

A patient was a second child of unconsanguineous parents. On the third day of birth, he was transferred to neonatal intensive care units because of severe lactic acidosis. Since he was showing continuous lactic acidosis, the oral supplementation of dichloroacetate (DCA) was introduced on 31st day of birth at initial dose of 50 mg/kg, followed by maintenance dose of 25 mg/kg/every 12 h. The patient was diagnosed with LS due to a point mutation of an A-C at nucleotide 599 in exon 6 in the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α gene, resulting in the substitution of aspartate for threonine at position 200 (N200T). Although the concentrations of lactate and pyruvate in blood were slightly decreased, his clinical conditions were deteriorating progressively. In order to overcome the mitochondrial or cytosolic energy crisis indicated by lactic acidosis as well as clinical symptoms, we terminated the DCA and administered 0.5 g/kg/day TID of sodium pyruvate orally. We analyzed the therapeutic effects of DCA or sodium pyruvate in the patient, and found that pyruvate therapy significantly decreased lactate, pyruvate and alanine levels, showed no adverse effects such as severe neuropathy seen in DCA, and had better clinical response on development and epilepsy.

Nonetheless, a plethora of pathogenic mutations have been described to date in the seven mitochondrial-encoded subunits of complex I as well as in 12 of the nuclear-encoded subunits and in six assembly factors. Whilst several mitochondrial DNA mutations are recurrent, the majority of these mutations are reported in single families. We have sequenced core structural and functional nuclear-encoded subunits of complex I in a cohort of 34 paediatric patients with isolated complex I deficiency, identifying pathogenic mutations in 6 patients. These included a novel homozygous NDUFS1 mutation in an Asian child with Leigh syndrome, a previously identified NDUFS8 mutation (c.236C>T, p.P79L) in a second Asian child with Leigh-like syndrome and six novel, compound heterozygous NDUFS2 mutations in four white Caucasian patients with Leigh or Leigh-like syndrome.

Moreover, the recessive neonatal isolated form of DCM has rarely been associated with a mutation. In this study, we present the association of a mutation in the SDHA gene with recessive neonatal isolated DCM in 15 patients of two large consanguineous Bedouin families. The cardiomyopathy is presumably caused by the significant tissue-specific reduction in SDH enzymatic activity in the heart muscle, whereas substantial activity is retained in the skeletal muscle and lymphoblastoid cells. Notably, the same mutation was previously reported to cause a multisystemic failure leading to neonatal death and Leigh's syndrome.

Recently, an increasing number of mutations in mitochondrial DNA encoding regions, especially in NADH dehydrogenase (respiratory chain complex I) subunits, have been reported as causative of early onset Leigh syndrome. We describe a patient whose fetal brain ultrasound demonstrated periventricular pseudocyst suggestive of a possible mitochondrial disorder who presented postnatally with Leigh syndrome. A muscle biopsy demonstrated a partial decrease in complex I and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH-E1 alpha) activity. Sequencing of the PDH-E1 alpha gene did not reveal any mutation. Sequencing of the mtDNA revealed a novel heteroplasmic G10254A (D66N) mutation in the ND3 gene. This change results in a substitution of aspartic acid to asparagine in a highly conserved domain of the ND3 subunit. The mutation could not be detected in the mother's blood or urine sediment. Blue native gel electrophoresis of muscle mitochondria revealed a normal size, albeit a decreased level of complex I. The G10254A substitution in the mtDNA-ND3 gene is another cause of maternally inherited Leigh syndrome. This case demonstrates that periventricular pseudocysts may be the initial in utero presentation in patients with mitochondrial disorders. We emphasize the importance of screening the mtDNA in pediatric patients as the first step in molecular diagnosis of Leigh syndrome.(c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Estimating this risk is difficult because of (a) heteroplasmy-the coexistence of mutant and normal mtDNA in the same person-and (b) the so-called mitochondrial bottleneck, whereby the small number of mtDNAs that become the founders for the offspring cause variation in dose of mutant mtDNA. The timing of the bottleneck and of segregation of mtDNA during foetal life determines the management options. Therefore, mtDNA heteroplasmy was studied in oocytes and placenta of women in affected families.One mother of a child dying from Leigh syndrome due to the 9176T-->C mtDNA mutation transmitted various loads of mutant mtDNA to < or =3 of 20 oocytes. This was used to estimate recurrence as < or =5%. She subsequently conceived a healthy son naturally. Analysis of the placenta showed that some segregation also occurred during placental development, with the mutant mtDNA load varying by >10% in a placenta carrying 65% 3243A-->G mutant mtDNA.This is the first report of (a) an oocyte analysis for preconception counselling, specifically, refining recurrence risks of rare mutations and (b) a widely different load of a pathogenic mtDNA mutation in multiple oocytes, apparently confined to the germline, in an asymptomatic carrier of an mtDNA disease. This suggests that a major component of the bottleneck occurs during oogenesis, probably early in the foetal life of the mother. The variable mutant load in placenta implies that estimates based on a single sample in prenatal diagnosis of mtDNA disorders have limited accuracy."

No additional mutations have been identified.To establish the prevalence of VAPB mutations, we screened 80 familial ALS samples by DNA sequencing.Our study failed to identify any novel VAPB gene mutations but identified a single Brazilian family harboring the P56S mutation. In a second familial ALS case, we identified a three-base pair deletion within exon 5 of the VAPB gene that deleted the serine residue at position 160 (Delta S160). This variant is detected in a normal population at low frequency (0.45%). Analyses of homology alignment and secondary structure predict that this deletion significantly alters the structure of VAPB, although a GFP-Delta S160 VAPB fusion protein demonstrates a wild-type subcellular localization. This contrasts the aberrant localization observed in a GFP-P56S VAPB fusion protein. The allele frequency of Delta S160 in patients with sporadic ALS does not differ significantly from that in the normal population.Mutations in the VAPB gene are rare and the Delta S160 variant does not contribute to the development of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."

How does inheritance 'determine' the clinical phenotype in familial tremor disorders? Here, we address these questions. Analogies between the neural circuits controlling rapid eye movements (saccades) and those controlling limb movements allow us to translate the interpretations from the saccadic systems to the limb movement system. Moreover, the relatively well understood neurophysiology of the ocular motor system offers a unique opportunity to test specific hypotheses about normal and abnormal motor control of both eye and limb movements. We describe a new familial disorder--'micro-saccadic oscillations and limb tremor (microSOLT)'--in a mother and daughter who had tiny saccadic oscillations of the eyes and tremor of the hands. This unique oscillatory movement disorder resembles other common tremor disorders (such as essential tremor) that occur in patients who have an otherwise normally functioning central nervous system. We hypothesize that microSOLT is caused by an inherited abnormality that results in abnormal membrane properties causing reduced external inhibition in the premotor neurons that generate the high-frequency discharge (burst) for saccades and for ballistic limb movements. To test this hypothesis, we recorded hand tremor and eye movements in two patients with microSOLT and particularly during natural circumstances when inhibition of the premotor saccadic burst neurons is removed (e.g. eye closure). We then simulated a conductance-based model for the premotor commands which included excitatory and reciprocally inhibitory burst neurons. The structure of this physiologically realistic model was based upon known cell types and anatomical connections in the brainstem (for saccades) and the thalamus (for limb movements). The physiological phenomenon of post-inhibitory rebound in premotor burst neurons makes the circuit inherently unstable and prone to oscillate unless prevented by external inhibition. Indeed, with simulated reduction of external inhibition (in this case glycinergic), saccadic oscillations and limb tremor were reproduced. Our results suggest that a single-inherited deficit can alter membrane properties, which impairs inhibition in an inherently unstable neural circuit causing the eye and limb oscillations in microSOLT. This concept has broad implications for understanding the mechanism and designing rationale pharmacotherapy for abnormal oscillations and may be applicable to other common disorders in which there are no structural abnormalities in the brain such as essential tremor."

We have studied 14 patients with mild 'unlabelled' methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) from 11 families. Eight of the families are from the Faroe Islands, having a common ancestor, and three are from southern Italy. Since the reaction catalysed by succinyl-CoA synthase in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle represents a distal step of the methylmalonic acid pathway, we investigated the SUCLA2 gene as a candidate gene in our patients. Genetic analysis of the gene in the 14 patients confirmed the defect in all patients and led to the identification of three novel mutations (p.Gly118Arg; p.Arg284Cys; c.534 + 1G --> A). The defect could be convincingly shown at the protein level and our data also confirm the previously described mitochondrial DNA depletion. Defects in SUCLA2 can be found at the metabolite level and are defined by mildly elevated methylmalonic acid and C4-dicarboxylic carnitine concentrations in body fluids in association with variable lactic acidosis. Clinically the diagnosis should be considered in patients with early/neonatal onset encephalomyopathy, dystonia, deafness and Leigh-like MRI abnormalities mainly affecting the putamen and the caudate nuclei. The frequency of the mutated allele in the Faroese population amounted to 2%, corresponding with an estimated homozygote frequency of 1 : 2500.

We describe the molecular and clinical findings in a family with variable disease severity and tissue T8993G mutant loads. Real-time ARMS qPCR testing showed that two brothers with features of NARP and LS had high mutant loads (>90%) in all tissues tested, similar to previously reported cases. Their sister, who has mild speech delay but attends normal school, was found to have a relatively high mutant load (mean 93%) in tissues derived from endoderm (buccal mucosa) and mesoderm (blood and skin fibroblasts). However, in tissue derived from ectoderm (hair bulbs), she carried a considerably lower proportion of mutant mtDNA. Because both surface ectoderm, which gives rise to outer epithelia and hair, and neuroectoderm, which gives rise to the central nervous system, are derived from ectoderm, it is tempting to speculate that the mutant load detected in the oligosymptomatic sister's hair bulbs is a reflection of the brain mutant load. We conclude that significant variation in tissue mutant load may occur in at least some individuals that harbor the T8993G mutation. This adds additional complexity to genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in such instances. Given the shared embryonic origin of hair bulbs and brain, we recommend performing hair bulb mtDNA analysis in asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic individuals that have high blood mutant loads in order to understand better the genotype-phenotype correlations related to the T8993G mutation."

We further showed that the truncated DSPI transcript is unstable, leading to a loss of DSPI. DSPI is reported to be an obligate constituent of desmosomes and the only isoform present in cardiac tissue. To address this, we reviewed the expression of DSP isoforms in the heart.

Since most patients had onset of hypertrichosis before the diagnosis of Leigh syndrome was made, we suggest that clinicians consider Leigh syndrome in patients with, for example, psychomotor retardation or other unspecific symptoms in combination with hypertrichosis.Copyright 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc"

It is associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes in infants, including Leigh syndrome, cardiomyopathy, and encephalomyopathy. In at least half of patients, enzyme deficiency results from a failure to assemble the holoenzyme complex; however, the molecular chaperones required for assembly of the mammalian enzyme remain unknown. Using whole genome subtraction of yeasts with and without a complex I to generate candidate assembly factors, we identified a paralogue (B17.2L) of the B17.2 structural subunit. We found a null mutation in B17.2L in a patient with a progressive encephalopathy and showed that the associated complex I assembly defect could be completely rescued by retroviral expression of B17.2L in patient fibroblasts. An anti-B17.2L antibody did not associate with the holoenzyme complex but specifically recognized an 830-kDa subassembly in several patients with complex I assembly defects and coimmunoprecipitated a subset of complex I structural subunits from normal human heart mitochondria. These results demonstrate that B17.2L is a bona fide molecular chaperone that is essential for the assembly of complex I and for the normal function of the nervous system."

Apart from the negative magnetic resonance findings, the other unusual feature was the early development of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Few conditions need to be considered in the differential diagnosis of a childhood-onset rapidly progressive extrapyramidal syndrome. Such conditions include Wilson's disease, Hallervorden-Spatz disease (HSD), juvenile form of Huntington's disease, juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, early-onset Machado-Joseph disease neuroacanthocytosis, storage disorders, and variant form of dopa-response dystonias (DRD). Rarer conditions are Leigh's disease, Lafora body disease, and dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy. HSD is a rare disorder characterized by progressive extrapyramidal dysfunction and dementia. Onset is most commonly in late childhood or early adolescence. The disease can be familial or sporadic. When familial, it is inherited recessively and has been linked to chromosome 20. Recently, a mutation in the pantothenate kinase (PANK2) gene on band 20pl3 has been described in patients with typical HSD. HSD produces typical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in brain, aiding in antemortem diagnosis. The typical finding is of bilaterally symmetrical hyperintense signal changes in the external segment of globus pallidus, with surrounding hypointensity on T(2)-weighted image. These imaging features are fairly diagnostic and have been termed the """"eye-of-the tiger sign"""". The hyperintensity represents pathologic changes, including gliosis, demyelination, neuronal loss, and axonal swelling, and the surrounding hypointensity is caused by loss of signal secondary to iron deposition. Described herein are the clinical aspects of a family with autosomal recessive inheritance with rapidly progressive extrapyramidal-pyramidal-dementia complex but with negative brain MRI results.

The assessment of muscle biopsies revealed a moderate single-fibre type II atrophy, a variation of muscle fibre calibre with focal fatty degeneration and a decreased reactivity of cytochrome-c oxidase. Although ragged red fibres had not been found, mitochondrial enzyme activities were markedly decreased with the lowest residual activity detected for NADH:Q1 oxidoreductase and NADH:O2 oxidoreductase (complex I deficiency), thereby confirming the diagnosis of mitochondrial myopathy. A molecular genetic analysis could not identify known mutations of mitochondrial DNA. Gastrointestinal full-thickness biopsies revealed myenteric hypoganglionosis of the colon and stomach and hyperplasia of the submucosal plexus of the ileum. Some of the intestinal smooth muscle cells displayed bulbous protrusions filled with lateralised mitochondria. Mitochondrial myopathies are known to be associated with a variety of clinical syndromes including CIP. However, in contrast to previous reports in which CIP has been attributed to visceral intestinal myopathies, the present case is characterised by neuronal intestinal malformations. Therefore, a mitochondrial myopathy associated with CIP requires a subtle assessment of both the intestinal smooth muscle and the enteric nervous system to identify the underlying pathology."

Recent studies in white patients indicate that SURF-1 gene mutations can cause Leigh syndrome associated with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. When we measured cytochrome c oxidase activity in cultured lymphoblastoid cells from our Japanese patients with typical Leigh syndrome, three patients demonstrated cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. Three novel mutations of the SURF-1 gene were identified in two of these three patients with cytochrome c oxidase deficiency. All mutations predicted loss of function of the SURF-1 protein; in both patients' cells, cytochrome c oxidase activity was decreased to less than 20% of the control mean. These results indicate that cultured lymphoblastoid cells are useful for elucidating the etiology of Leigh syndrome, and that loss of function of the SURF-1 gene product can be responsible for Leigh syndrome associated with severe cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in Japanese patients."

The presence of severe lactic acidosis and Leigh-like lesions of putamina prompted us to perform muscle and skin biopsies. In both, a profound, isolated defect of COX was found by histochemical and biochemical assays. Sequence analysis of muscle mtDNA resulted in the identification of a virtually homoplasmic frameshift mutation in the COIII gene, due to the insertion of an extra C at nucleotide position 9537 of mtDNA. Although the 9537C(ins) does not impair transcription of COIII, no full-length COX III protein was detected in mtDNA translation assays in vivo. Western blot analysis of two-dimensional blue-native electrophoresis showed a reduction of specific crossreacting material and the accumulation of early-assembly intermediates of COX, whereas the fully assembled complex was absent. One of these intermediates had an electrophoretic mobility different from those seen in controls, suggesting the presence of a qualitative abnormality of COX assembly. Immunostaining with specific antibodies failed to detect the presence of several smaller subunits in the complex lacking COX III, in spite of the demonstration that these subunits were present in the crude mitochondrial fraction of patient's cultured fibroblasts.

COX consists of ten nuclear-encoded and three mtDNA-encoded structural subunits. Although the nucleotide sequences of all 13 genes are known, no mutation was found in nuclear-encoded subunit genes of COX-deficiency patients. Zhu et al. (1998) and Tiranti et al.

The mouse surfeit gene cluster consists of six closely spaced housekeeping genes unrelated by sequence homology. Except for the Surf3 gene, the function is still not known. The juxtaposition of at least five of the surfeit genes is conserved between birds and mammals. We identified two novel mutations of SURF1 in a Japanese LS patient with COX deficiency using direct sequencing analysis. Firstly, a 2-bp deletion at nucleotide position 790 (790delAG) in exon 8 was found, which shifts the reading frame such that the mutant protein has a completely different amino acid sequence from codon 264 to the premature stop codon at 290. Secondly, we found a T-to-G transversion at nucleotide 820, resulting in the substitution of tyrosine by aspartic acid at codon 274 (Y274D). We also studied the parents' genes, and found that the Y274D mutation was in his father and the 790delAG mutation was in his mother heterozygously. Therefore, we concluded that the patient was a compound heterozygote with these mutations. These are the first pathogenetic SURF1 mutations identified in a Japanese family."

The tissues and cultured fibroblasts of the patient with Leigh's syndrome showed a COX deficiency of systemic character. The decrease of COX activity to 5-11 per cent was accompanied by proportionally decreased content of the assembled COX enzyme. With the help of transmitochondrial cybrids derived from patient fibroblasts it was proven that the COX defect was of nuclear origin. In a successive pregnancy, the function of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was analysed in cultured amniocytes by substrate-stimulated ATP production and COX activity was compared with the activity of citrate synthase. The amount and composition of OXPHOS complexes was estimated by two-dimensional (Blue Native/SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was verified immunochemically with specific antibodies.

Empirical risks were recently provided for MELAS and MERRF syndromes and for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. In MELAS and MERFF, higher levels of mutant mtDNA in the mothers' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and Kearns-Sayre syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring. As Leigh syndrome is found with maternal, autosomal recessive or X chromosomal transmission, the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling.

Other problems included hypotonia, hypoglycaemia, neurological abnormalities (including Leigh syndrome) and cataracts. Liver histology showed geographic areas of fatty change, bile duct proliferation, collapse of liver architecture and fibrosis; some cells showed decreased cytochrome oxidase activity. Muscle from three patients showed mitochondrial proliferation, with loss of cytochrome oxidase activity in some fibres but not in others; in these cases, muscle mitochondrial DNA levels were less than 5% of the median control value. The remaining two patients (from a single pedigree) had normal muscle histology and histochemistry associated with less severe depletion of mitochondrial DNA in muscle.Liver failure is common in patients with mitochondrial DNA depletion. Associated clinical features often include neuromuscular disease. Liver and muscle histology can be helpful in making the diagnosis.

In this study, we report two unrelated patients, both of consanguineous parentage, who presented with cutaneous blistering and a hoarse cry from birth. Both experienced inspiratory stridor and respiratory distress, necessitating emergency tracheostomy in one case.

In 3 affected boys, ranging in age from 3 months to 8 years, the mutation was found in 95-99% of the mtDNA population. The clinical symptoms correlated with the mtDNA heteroplasmy and in the healthy mother 50% of the mtDNA was mutated. The rate of mitochondrial ATP production by cultured skin fibroblasts containing 99% of mutated mtDNA was about 2-fold lower than that in normal fibroblasts. Native electrophoresis of the mitochondrial enzyme complexes revealed instability of the FlFo-ATPase in all the tissues of the patient that were investigated (heart, muscle, kidney, liver). Only a small portion of the ATP-synthase complex was present in the complete, intact form (620 kDa). Incomplete forms of the enzyme were present as subcomplexes with approx. molecular weights of 460, 390 and 150 kDa, respectively, which differed in the content of F1 and Fo subunits. Immunochemical analysis of the subunits of the FlFo-ATPase further revealed a markedly decreased content of the Fo subunit b in mitochondria from muscle and heart, and an increased content of the Fo subunit c in muscle mitochondria, respectively. These results indicate that in this family the T-->G point mutation at position 8993 in the mitochondrial ATPase 6 gene is accompanied by structural instability and altered assembly of the enzyme complex, that are both most likely due to changes in the properties of subunit a of the membrane sector part of the ATP-synthase."

This experience was reflected in a literature review encompassing 284 cases of LS. However, only 26.4% had MD. Eleven patients, including one of our cases, presented as the primary torsion dystonia phenotype. There are clinical and pathological similarities between LS and other metabolic diseases affecting the central nervous system. The enhanced vulnerability of the nervous system to metabolic stress and the resemblance in the distribution of the pathology of these diverse conditions suggests a common pathogenetic mechanism. An excitotoxin-mediated mechanism is favored, one which might account for the frequent involvement of the basal ganglia in LS."

Somatic complaints are common, including chronic diarrhea, recurrent vomiting, anorexia, and decelerating body and head growth. The second stage evolves during late infancy and early childhood when motor regression becomes evident. Eye signs, altered breathing patterns, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, and cerebellar signs emerge and sudden clinical deterioration occurs during intercurrent infectious or metabolic stress.

SNE of infancy can be defined and diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms more readily than juvenile and adult forms. Four patients with SNE displayed combinations of recurrent vomiting, difficulty in swallowing, failure to thrive, impairment of ocular innervation, muscle tone regulation and central regulation of respiration. These symptoms, particularly in combination, point to a disorder of the brainstem and basal ganglia. In addition, all four patients were suffering from lactic acidosis. Other possible indicators, but not in all 4 patients, were abnormal CT brain scans, impaired nerve conduction velocity, elevated CSF protein levels and enlarged mitochondria in muscle cells. Abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials have proved to be one of the best criteria for early diagnosis of brainstem lesions. Enzyme assays of pyruvate degradation in cultured skin fibroblasts revealed diminished activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in one patient (52 pmol/mg protein x min; median range 313, 82-917, n: 58). This paper summarizes the findings and proposes primary and secondary criteria of assistance in establishing an initial clinical diagnosis of infantile SNE. As no common pathogenetic mechanisms have yet been recognized and no uniform diagnostic markers are yet available, the diagnosis still requires confirmation by histological examination of brain and brainstem, as was the case with all four patients presented."

Enzymological studies of postmortem samples revealed low nonactivated pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in liver (19.4%) and brain (53.8%). The lowest brain pyruvate dehydrogenase activities were noted in the midbrain and pontine regions. Supramaximal activation of the hepatic pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (135% of control values) occurred in vitro. Spontaneous reactivation following in vitro inactivation of the complex with adenosine triphosphate was significantly less (p less than 0.02) in the patient's samples compared to controls. The biochemical defect was not apparent in fibroblasts. These enzymological observations point to an in vivo defect in the activation mechanism of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex as the biochemical disturbance in SNE. The findings suggest that dichloroacetate may be beneficial in treating SNE."

Normal cytochrome c oxidase activity was present in liver tissue. Because of the markedly higher levels of pyruvate and lactate in CSF compared with blood and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio in CSF, there may also have been defective activity of cytochrome c oxidase in brain tissue. After a period of apparently normal development, the child's clinical condition gradually deteriorated and she died at age 6 years due to respiratory insufficiency.

One of the organic acids that should be looked for in such a patient is lactic acid. Lactic acidosis due to tissue hypoxia is a well-known phenomenon (e.g., in shock and cardiopulmonary disease) and has not been discussed in this essay; nor has lactic acidosis due to exogenous causes like infusion of fructose or sorbitol, or admiministration of phenformin. Chronic lactic acidosis in infancy is a rare condition. It may be associated with glycogen storage disease Type 1, fructose diphosphatase deficiency, methylmalonic acidemia, propionic acidemia, pyruvate carboxylase or dehydrogenase deficiency and Leigh's subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy (SNE). Some patients with chronic lactic acidosis do not have nay of these diseases and comprise an """"idiopathic"""" group. This is a heterogeneous group, probably having several different causes for the metabolic error. In Leigh's SNE, a metabolic block in the formation of thiamine triphosphate in brain has been demonstrated and has been attributed to the presence of an inhibitor of thiamine pyrophosphate-adenosine triphosphate (TPP-ATP) phosphoryl transferase in body fluids. The inhibitor has also been encountered in cases of intermittent cerebellar ataxia and of primary hypoventilation (Ondine's curse), which may represent variants of Leigh's disease. Increased blood levels of lactate, pyruvate and alanine frequently are encountered in SNE, but it still is not clear whether they are due to a primary or secondary disturbance in the catabolism of pyruvate. Disturbed lactate and pyruvate metabolism has also been encountered in isolated cases of mental retardation and growth failure, in mitochondrial myopathies and in polyneuropathies, and may be expected to occur in Wernicke's encephalopathy. Finally, it has been noted in malignancy and in association with other rare metabolic disorders."
