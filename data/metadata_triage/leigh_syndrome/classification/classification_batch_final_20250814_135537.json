    "reasoning": "The study involves laboratory techniques such as cryo-ET, cryo-CLEM, and LDSAED to investigate calcium-phosphate sheets in cortical neurons isolated from embryonic day 18 rat embryos. This is a preclinical study focusing on understanding the mechanism of calcium-phosphate aggregation in neurons, which has implications for neurological disorders but does not involve human patients or clinical interventions. The findings are translational, linking mitochondrial function to pathological calcification in diseases like Alzheimer's, hence the medium clinical relevance.",

    "reasoning": "The abstract describes a study involving exome sequencing of 2,820 French-Canadian participants, including patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), parents, and controls from the Quebec IBD cohort. This indicates a cohort study design, as it involves observational analysis of a defined group over time. The study focuses on genetic features and variant enrichment, which is more translational (medium clinical relevance) rather than directly applicable to patient care. The high confidence score reflects clear indicators of cohort study design and genetic analysis.",
