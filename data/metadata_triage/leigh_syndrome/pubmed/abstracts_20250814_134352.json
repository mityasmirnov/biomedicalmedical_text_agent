Extracellular calcium-phosphate in the nervous system is not well understood, but prior evidence suggests mitochondria as a potential source. Recently, large unidentified double-membrane-bound hyper-electron dense sheet aggregates of unknown content were reported in Huntington's disease model neurons using cryo-ET that were absent in wild-type control neurons. We use a combination of cryo-ET, cryo-CLEM, and LDSAED to demonstrate that these sheet aggregates are generated by wild-type cortical neurons isolated from embryonic day 18 rat embryos and have an octacalcium phosphate-like structure. They appear to be derived from mitochondria and are extruded at least in part by migrasomes. These findings reveal an important link for how mitochondria can serve as reservoirs for intracellular and extracellular calcium-phosphate highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets in neurological disorders characterized by pathological calcification, such as Alzheimer's disease.",
  "40791678": "1 The genetic features of founder populations with recent bottlenecks, causing some deleterious variants to rise to higher frequencies, can enhance the power of rare variant association studies. French Canadians from Quebec represent a recent founder population with a particular disease heritage comprising more than 30 prevalent Mendelian conditions. Here, we characterize coding variation in this founder population using exome sequencing data from 2,820 French-Canadian participants - patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), parents and controls from the Quebec IBD cohort. We find that 18% of rare coding variants are 10-100 times more frequent than in non-Finnish Europeans (NFE). A total of 4,133 missense and loss-of-function variants were significantly enriched with a median 28-fold enrichment, revealing the potential for genotype-phenotype associations in this population. We describe significantly enriched pathogenic variants, including those known to account for the increased prevalence of rare diseases in FC compared to other European descent populations, such as Agenesis of corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy ( ",
  "40791373": "Mitochondrial complex I (CI) deficiency represents a common biochemical pathophysiology underlying Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS), manifesting with progressive multi-system dysfunction, lactic acidemia, and early mortality. To facilitate mechanistic studies and rigorous screening of therapeutic candidates for CI deficient LSS, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate an ",
  "40786033": "BACKGROUND: Zagociguat (zag) is a CNS-penetrant, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator that has been evaluated in phase 2a, with phase 2b ongoing, clinical studies of primary mitochondrial disease (PMD) subjects with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS). To explore its utility in a broader array of PMDs and secondary mitochondrial disorders, we performed prfeclinical modeling of zag across larval and adult zebrafish models with biochemical deficiencies in diverse respiratory chain (RC) complexes or dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Dldh). METHODS: Zag was evaluated for tissue uptake, gross toxicity, protection from RC toxin-induced brain death, neuromuscular dysfunction, heartbeat loss, and biochemical dysfunction in transgenic or toxin-exposed zebrafish with mitochondrial enzyme deficiencies in complex I ( RESULTS: Similar zag levels were observed in adult brains and tail muscle. No morphological or functional toxic effects of zag were observed on larvae viability. Zag provided neuromuscular protection in complex I deficient genetic and pharmacologic inhibitor models. In complex IV deficient models, prevention from brain death occurred at 100\u00a0nM zag in high-dose azide-exposed WT larvae; however, no rescue of swimming or neuromuscular phenotypes in low-dose azide-exposed  CONCLUSION: Preclinical evaluation of zag demonstrated its safety, significant protection of neuromuscular dysfunction and/or acute RC stressor-induced decompensation, and improved mitochondrial physiology across multiple different genetic and/or pharmacologic models of RC-deficient PMD. Thus, zag may yield therapeutic potential for an array of diseases with mitochondrial dysfunction beyond MELAS, potentially including Leigh syndrome spectrum disorder and primary mitochondrial myopathies.",
  "40770507": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by inclusions of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Patients with PD anecdotally experience symptom improvement at high altitude; chronic hypoxia prevents the development of Leigh-like brain disease in mice with mitochondrial complex I deficiency. Here we report that intrastriatal injection of \u03b1-syn preformed fibrils (PFFs) in mice resulted in neurodegeneration and movement disorder, which were prevented by continuous exposure to 11% oxygen. Specifically, PFF-induced \u03b1-syn aggregation resulted in brain tissue hyperoxia, lipid peroxidation and DA neurodegeneration in the SNpc of mice breathing 21% oxygen, but not in those breathing 11% oxygen. This neuroprotective effect of hypoxia was also observed in Caenorhabditis elegans. Moreover, initiating hypoxia 6 weeks after PFF injection reversed motor dysfunction and halted further DA neurodegeneration. These results suggest that hypoxia may have neuroprotective effects downstream of \u03b1-syn aggregation in PD, even after symptom onset and neuropathological changes."
