  "40799591": "Calcium-phosphate is a critical component in healthy bone and teeth formation, but its pathologic buildup in brain can occur in dyshomeostatic calcium disorders like Alzheimer's disease and Leigh syndrome. Extracellular calcium-phosphate in the nervous system is not well understood, but prior evidence suggests mitochondria as a potential source. Recently, large unidentified double-membrane-bound hyper-electron dense sheet aggregates of unknown content were reported in Huntington's disease model neurons using cryo-ET that were absent in wild-type control neurons. We use a combination of cryo-ET, cryo-CLEM, and LDSAED to demonstrate that these sheet aggregates are generated by wild-type cortical neurons isolated from embryonic day 18 rat embryos and have an octacalcium phosphate-like structure. They appear to be derived from mitochondria and are extruded at least in part by migrasomes. These findings reveal an important link for how mitochondria can serve as reservoirs for intracellular and extracellular calcium-phosphate highlighting them as potential therapeutic targets in neurological disorders characterized by pathological calcification, such as Alzheimer's disease.",
  "40791678": "1 The genetic features of founder populations with recent bottlenecks, causing some deleterious variants to rise to higher frequencies, can enhance the power of rare variant association studies. French Canadians from Quebec represent a recent founder population with a particular disease heritage comprising more than 30 prevalent Mendelian conditions. Here, we characterize coding variation in this founder population using exome sequencing data from 2,820 French-Canadian participants - patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), parents and controls from the Quebec IBD cohort. We find that 18% of rare coding variants are 10-100 times more frequent than in non-Finnish Europeans (NFE). A total of 4,133 missense and loss-of-function variants were significantly enriched with a median 28-fold enrichment, revealing the potential for genotype-phenotype associations in this population. We describe significantly enriched pathogenic variants, including those known to account for the increased prevalence of rare diseases in FC compared to other European descent populations, such as Agenesis of corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy ( ",
  "40791373": "Mitochondrial complex I (CI) deficiency represents a common biochemical pathophysiology underlying Leigh syndrome spectrum (LSS), manifesting with progressive multi-system dysfunction, lactic acidemia, and early mortality. To facilitate mechanistic studies and rigorous screening of therapeutic candidates for CI deficient LSS, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate an "
