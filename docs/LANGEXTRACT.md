Awesome choice—**LangExtract** is a great fit here because it enforces a structured schema, grounds every extraction to the exact source span, and scales to long PDFs with chunking/parallel passes. It also runs with **local LLMs via Ollama** or with cloud models, so you can keep costs near-zero on your own GPU/M-series Macs. ([GitHub][1])

Below is a **drop-in strategy** + a **copy-ready prompt, example, and extraction objects** tailored to Leigh-syndrome case reports.

---

# Strategy to use LangExtract for your pipeline

**What LangExtract brings**

* **Grounded spans**: each extraction is tied to character offsets for audit/QA.
* **Schema enforcement** via few-shot examples; no JSON drift.
* **Long doc handling** with chunking + multi-pass recall.
* **Ollama support** for local models (e.g., Qwen/Mistral) or Gemini/OpenAI in the cloud. ([GitHub][1], [Google Developers Blog][2])

**How we integrate**

1. **Define an extraction schema** (classes + attributes) that mirrors your graph/relational model.
2. **Create “task packs”** (prompt + few-shot examples) for:

   * **A4-Phenotype/HPO**, **A4-Variant/HGVS**, **A4-Treatment/RxNorm**, **A4-Labs/LOINC**, **A4-Timeline**.
3. **Run multi-pass extraction**:

   * Pass-1: “all-concept” sweep (high recall).
   * Pass-2: focused passes (variants, labs, treatments, temporals).
   * Pass-3: **patient resolution** (link spans to per-patient clusters via your A3 resolver).
4. **Post-map** attributes to ontologies with your existing services (HPO/MONDO/SNOMED/ICD-10/ORPHA/LOINC/RxNorm/HGNC/SO).
5. **Persist**: write LangExtract JSONL → Neo4j/Postgres and generate the built-in HTML viz for curator review. ([GitHub][1])

# Copy-ready prompt (v1)

> **Task:** Extract **patient-level** findings from Leigh syndrome case reports. Use **exact spans** from the text (no paraphrase). For each extraction, set:
>
> * `extraction_class`: one of
>   `Patient`, `Gene`, `Variant`, `Phenotype`, `OnsetAge`, `DeathAge`, `Treatment`, `Outcome`, `LabMeasurement`, `ImagingFinding`, `Milestone`, `AdverseEvent`, `HeteroplasmyPct`.
> * `extraction_text`: the **minimal** source text span expressing the fact.
> * `attributes`: a dict with keys (fill when present in span or nearby context):
>
>   * **global**: `patient_label` (e.g., “Patient 2”, “Case III-2”), `section` (“Case report”, “Results”), `negated` (true/false).
>   * **Phenotype**: `phenotype_text`, `hpo_id_if_present`, `age_months_if_present`.
>   * **Gene**: `symbol`, `hgnc_hint_if_present`.
>   * **Variant**: `hgvs_c_if_present`, `hgvs_p_if_present`, `genome` (“GRCh38”, “rCRS”), `zygosity_if_present`.
>   * **OnsetAge/DeathAge**: `value`, `unit` (months/years).
>   * **Treatment**: `drug_text`, `dose_text`, `route_if_present`, `rxnorm_hint_if_present`, `start_age_months_if_present`.
>   * **Outcome**: `outcome_text` (e.g., “died at 22 months”, “improved seizure control”).
>   * **LabMeasurement**: `analyte_text`, `value_text`, `unit_text`, `age_months_if_present`.
>   * **ImagingFinding**: `modality` (MRI/CT/MRS), `finding_text`.
>   * **Milestone**: `event_text` (e.g., “sat unsupported”), `attained_age_months`, `lost_age_months_if_present`.
>   * **AdverseEvent**: `event_text`, `severity_text_if_present`.
>   * **HeteroplasmyPct**: `value_text`.
>
> **Rules:**
> • Keep spans tight; do not infer IDs unless explicitly in text (IDs will be mapped post-hoc).
> • If the text lists a range (“18–20 months”), record `value_text` verbatim.
> • If a single sentence mentions multiple patients, emit **separate** extractions with the correct `patient_label`.
> • Never duplicate overlapping extractions; prefer the most specific class.

# Few-shot example (LangExtract objects)

```python
import langextract as lx
example_text = (
  "Patient 2 presented at 6 months with hypotonia (HP:0001252) and ptosis (HP:0000508). "
  "Genetic testing identified MT-ATP6 m.8993T>G (heteroplasmy 85%). "
  "MRI showed bilateral basal ganglia lesions. Riboflavin 100 mg/day was started; lactate fell to 2.1 mmol/L."
)

examples = [
  lx.data.ExampleData(
    text=example_text,
    extractions=[
      lx.data.Extraction(
        extraction_class="Patient",
        extraction_text="Patient 2",
        attributes={"patient_label":"Patient 2"}
      ),
      lx.data.Extraction(

      ),
      lx.data.Extraction(
        extraction_class="Phenotype",
        extraction_text="ptosis (HP:0000508)",
        attributes={"phenotype_text":"ptosis","hpo_id_if_present":"HP:0000508"}
      ),

        attributes={"hgvs_mt_if_present":"m.8993T>G","genome":"rCRS"}
      ),

        extraction_class="HeteroplasmyPct",
        extraction_text="heteroplasmy 85%",
        attributes={"value_text":"85%"}
      ),
      lx.data.Extraction(
        extraction_class="ImagingFinding",
        extraction_text="MRI showed bilateral basal ganglia lesions",
        attributes={"modality":"MRI","finding_text":"bilateral basal ganglia lesions"}
      ),
      lx.data.Extraction(
        extraction_class="Treatment",
        extraction_text="Riboflavin 100 mg/day",
        attributes={"drug_text":"Riboflavin","dose_text":"100 mg/day"}
      ),
      lx.data.Extraction(
        extraction_class="LabMeasurement",
        extraction_text="lactate fell to 2.1 mmol/L",
        attributes={"analyte_text":"lactate","value_text":"2.1","unit_text":"mmol/L"}
      ),
      lx.data.Extraction(
        extraction_class="OnsetAge",
        extraction_text="6 months",
        attributes={"value":"6","unit":"months"}
      )
    ]
  )
]
```

> You can run this with a local model via **Ollama** (e.g., `model_id="ollama/qwen2.5:7b-instruct"`), or with Gemini/OpenAI; LangExtract supports both and keeps the same schema and visualization pipeline. ([GitHub][1])

---

# Running it (single file)

```python
import langextract as lx
result = lx.extract(
    text_or_documents=full_case_text,
    prompt_description=PROMPT_ABOVE,
    examples=examples,
    model_id="ollama/qwen2.5:7b-instruct",  # or "gemini-2.5-flash"
    extraction_passes=3,            # boosts recall
    max_workers=8,                  # parallel chunks
    max_char_buffer=1000            # smaller contexts
)
lx.io.save_annotated_documents([result], output_name="le-extractions.jsonl")
html = lx.visualize("le-extractions.jsonl")  # interactive QA review
```

LangExtract’s README shows this exact workflow, including the **ExampleData / Extraction** schema, multi-pass parameters, Ollama integration, and HTML visualization. ([GitHub][1])

# Post-processing & ontology mapping (drop-in)

After saving `le-extractions.jsonl`, run your existing normalisers:

* **Phenotype** → `hpo_id_if_present` (if empty) via string-to-HPO linker.
* **Gene** → map `symbol` to **HGNC**.
* **Variant** → normalise to **HGVS/SO** (Mutalyzer/biocommons).
* **Treatment** → map `drug_text` to **RxNorm/ATC**.
* **LabMeasurement** → map `(analyte_text, unit_text)` to **LOINC/UCUM**.
* Push to **Neo4j/Postgres** with patient linkage from your A3 resolver.

---

# Notes & options

* LangExtract ships with **interactive visualization** and a **JSONL format** that’s easy to slot into your CI and curator review loops. ([GitHub][1])
* If you want to keep *everything* local, you can serve **Ollama** models and still use LangExtract’s schema/visualizer unchanged. ([GitHub][1])
* For more background on its design (schema control, grounding, chunking/parallel), see the **launch post**. ([Google Developers Blog][2])

If you want, I can tailor **task-pack prompts** for your 17 concept services (variants, labs, treatments, temporals, milestones, etc.) so each runs as a LangExtract pass and drops straight into your current Neo4j/HPO/RxNorm/LOINC mapping.
