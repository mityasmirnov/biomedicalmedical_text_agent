# Biomedical Text Agent - Comprehensive TODO List




Biomedical Data Extraction Engine - Comprehensive Improvement Plan
Executive Summary
The codebase represents a sophisticated biomedical text extraction system with a well-architected foundation. The LangExtract integration is already implemented but could be better integrated into the main pipeline. The system shows good separation of concerns but has some redundancy and areas for optimization.

1. LangExtract Integration into Existing Pipeline
Current State
LangExtract is implemented as a separate module in src/langextract_integration/
It has its own extraction engine, normalizer, and schema classes
Currently operates independently from the main extraction orchestrator
Integration Strategy
1.1 Create LangExtract Agent
Location: src/agents/extraction_agents/langextract_agent.py

Input/Output Specification:

Input: PatientSegment objects with text content
Output: ProcessingResult containing structured extractions matching the existing schema
Integration Point: Replace or augment the current genetics/phenotypes agents
1.2 Update Extraction Orchestrator
Location: src/agents/orchestrator/extraction_orchestrator.py

Changes:

Add LangExtract agent as an option alongside existing agents
Implement fallback strategy: LangExtract → Traditional agents → Rule-based extraction
Maintain backward compatibility with existing pipeline
1.3 Schema Alignment
Location: src/langextract_integration/schema_classes.py

Changes:

Align extraction classes with existing PatientRecord schema
Ensure output format matches what the database expects
Add validation for schema compliance
