      "2. Return strictly valid JSON that conforms to the attribute schemas and enumerations.\n",
      "3. Use exact text spans for extraction_text (no paraphrasing).\n",
      "4. For genes: use official HGNC symbols when possible (e.g., SURF1, MT-ATP6, SLC19A3).\n",
      "5. For variants: use HGVS notation if present (c.26T>C, p.Leu9Pro).\n",
      "6. For phenotypes: keep the concise surface form from text (we will map to HPO downstream).\n",
      "7. For ages: convert months to decimal years (5 months → 0.42, 2 years 5 months → 2.42).\n",
      "8. For negation: set negated=true only if explicit negation words apply (no, without, denies, absent).\n",
      "9. For zygosity: only specify if words like 'homozygous', 'heterozygous', or 'compound' appear.\n",
      "10. For outcomes: use brief, factual descriptions (improvement, no response, stabilization, death).\n",
